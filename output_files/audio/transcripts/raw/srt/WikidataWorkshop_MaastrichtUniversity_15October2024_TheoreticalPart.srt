00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Hello everybody, welcome to this workshop on Wikidata for the University of Maastricht

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:17,440
on the 15th of October 2024. My name is Olaf, I'm the Wikimedia Coordinator at the National

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,560
Library of the Netherlands. And today, for the next two and a half hours, I will guide

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:33,360
this workshop on Wikidata related to professors here at Maastricht University. And this workshop

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,540
will be in two parts. It will be first a theoretical introduction where we will look at the basics

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:49,200
of Wikidata, so really the principles and founding guidances of Wikidata. And also in

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,440
the theoretical part we will look at how we can use Wikidata in research, science and

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,240
cultural heritage. That will be about an hour, so that will be me presenting the theory to

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,640
you. And of course, if you have any questions, you can send me an email or we can have a

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,800
chat if you would like to know more about that part of Wikidata. Then we have a short

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,920
break and after the break there will be a second theoretical part, so where you will actually try

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:31,560
to make your first edits and contributions to Wikidata, themed by data on professors of

13
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,840
Maastricht University. For the second part, there's actually a separate video available which

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,560
you will find on the page this video is in. I recorded it also today when it was still daylight.

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,400
So if you want to work through that workshop, the practical part of the workshop yourself,

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:59,520
then you can go and check out that video. And the second part is between 75 or 90 minutes,

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,520
but for this particular video that I'm recording now, I will actually only do the basics of Wikidata,

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:17,400
so that will be approximately an hour of video you will have had. So let me go on to the opening

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,400
slide of this theoretical part. As I said, I'm Olaf Janssen, I'm with the National Library of

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,360
the Netherlands. And for the next hour, we will look at the basics of Wikidata. So what Wikidata

21
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,960
is, what are the principles of Wikidata, both from the technical and social point of view,

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:46,840
and with social, I mean the community point of view. And then in the second part of this first

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,320
theoretical block, I will show you some case studies on how Wikidata can be relevant for

24
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,840
the domains of research, science and cultural heritage. Perhaps a small introduction about

25
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,280
myself. As I said, I'm with the National Library of the Netherlands, and I'm the Wikimedia

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,840
Coordinator of our library. And in that role, which I've been fulfilling for 10 years now,

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,640
I try to bring two worlds together. On the one hand, there is the world of the KB with our

28
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,280
collections and our data and our books, of course, and our information and our people.

29
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,800
And on the other hand, there is the world of Wikipedia, for instance, Encyclopedia, but also

30
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:39,560
projects like Wikidata that we'll discuss today, or the image repository of Wikipedia called

31
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Wikimedia Commons. And the volunteers of creators, or sorry, the communities of creators, mostly

32
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,840
volunteers, that work on these platforms to sustain them and to grow them. In these two worlds,

33
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:03,000
I try to collaborate them together to mutual benefit. For instance, we as the KB take a lot

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,680
of information from Wikipedia, Wikidata, but also make sure that we contribute to Wikidata. And one

35
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,320
of the contributions that we also do, it's not only adding data to Wikidata, but also educating

36
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,960
other heritage institutions and other universities about Wikidata. This is exactly the thing that I'm

37
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,280
doing right now. So I'm sharing my knowledge with you and hopefully the wider Wikimedia community

38
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:40,760
just for mutual benefit, so to say. All right, so what do I hope that you will have

39
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:47,160
learned or gained some more understanding of by the end of this afternoon? First of all,

40
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,880
that you have a basic idea of what Wikidata is, how it works, both from the technical perspective,

41
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,880
like the data perspective, and also from the community slash social perspective. So that you

42
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:07,880
will also have a little insight in how the community around Wikidata is organized.

43
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Because I put it here on purpose, because in many introductory talks about Wikidata,

44
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:22,520
it only focuses on this real hard data aspect of Wikidata. But for me, the community aspects are

45
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,520
equally important, actually. And actually, I think they're even more important than the technical

46
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,960
aspects of Wikidata. And why I think so, I will discuss later on in this presentation.

47
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:43,000
Then next, the second learning goal is trying to give you a small insight into how Wikidata can be

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,400
relevant for research, science, and cultural heritage. And then lastly, and this is the second

49
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:59,400
part of the workshop, the practical part, for which a separate video is available also, is trying to

50
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,760
guide you through making your first steps into Wikidata yourself. So doing your first contributions

51
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:13,640
focused on data of professors here at Maastricht University. So let's start simply by asking

52
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:21,480
ourselves, what is Wikidata? Well, if you talk with people about Wikidata, you get a wide variety

53
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:31,320
of answers. But depending on their view on Wikidata and their level of experience with

54
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:39,640
Wikidata, I think the most basic thing you can explain about Wikidata is that it is a database

55
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:48,360
containing structured descriptions of all sorts of things. And what kinds of things are,

56
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,320
can you think of, for instance, it as a description, a structured description of the Eiffel Tower,

57
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:06,040
or this valley in Antarctica, or this hit single by Girlfriend, or this book, or this American judge,

58
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:14,040
or this airport in the United States, or this gene, or this election in Catalonia,

59
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,560
or this scientific article, or this species of insect, or this composition by Robert Schumann,

60
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,280
or this street in the Netherlands, or this family name, or this quasar in the constellation of

61
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,160
Urza Meyer, or this really nice car, or this really nice metal band, or this international

62
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,840
football association, or this cannabis seed bank in Canada, or this researcher, or this randomly

63
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,160
chosen library from the Netherlands. So you see there are a lot of different things described in

64
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:59,400
Wikidata. In total, when I last checked it, nearly 114 million distinct things are described in

65
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:07,800
Wikidata. To give you just a short glimpse of what kind of groups together, like classes,

66
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,160
there are described in Wikidata. It has a lot of scientific articles to start with. This is the

67
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,640
the green pie chart. I will come back to that towards the end of my presentation, why it is

68
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:26,280
such a big chunk. But also there are roughly some 5 million people, 5 to 6 million people described

69
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,800
in Wikidata, animal and plants, etc. Chemical substances, thousands and thousands of

70
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,520
astronomical objects, genes, really a lot of genes are available in Wikidata, etc.

71
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,680
So Wikidata is both very broad, but it can also be very specific, like it has

72
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,080
currently nearly 900 descriptions of Van Gogh paintings.

73
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:04,040
If you take all the things in Wikidata that have geographical coordinates, like longitude

74
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,440
and latitude, and you plot them on a map, you get this map, which was last created a year ago.

75
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,120
Basically, this is a map of where people live, because where people live, they tend to describe

76
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,560
their things in their surroundings. And it's typically along the coast. You will see,

77
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:35,800
for instance, also this kind of map with other data points related to human civilization and

78
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,840
where humans live. Okay, so that was a really brief introduction into Wikidata, really basic.

79
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,440
What I would like to do next in the second part of the talk is to have a look at the principles

80
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:59,800
that are guiding Wikidata. And those are seven. And let me just start by the first one.

81
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,160
Wikidata contains structured descriptions of things. You can think, for instance, about

82
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,840
Wikipedia. Wikipedia also contains descriptions of things, but those descriptions are free text.

83
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,040
So they are not structured. And what do I mean by structured? It's the following, like there is,

84
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,880
for instance, the Eiffel Tower is described in Wikidata. And you can see here that the Eiffel

85
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,360
Tower is named after Gustave Eiffel. And it is situated in the country of France. And it is the

86
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,080
property of the government of France. And these are structured descriptions. So it's a

87
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:49,240
thing, the Eiffel Tower, and it has this property, which has a value here. And in this way,

88
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:58,040
the entire Wikidata item is structured. What you notice here is that this description of the Eiffel

89
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,120
Tower is in English. All the fields that you see here, all these strings and all these

90
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,400
things here, those are all in English. Why that's important, you will find out in a moment.

91
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:19,560
Then secondly, all these 114 million descriptions are stored in one big central system. At least

92
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,520
for the user, that is the experience. Behind the scenes, I think there will be multiple databases

93
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:34,600
working together. But for the user experience, it's one big storage of data. And data is not

94
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:42,040
available only in English, but in over 200 different languages. And that's why I just

95
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,240
showed you the English interface. You can also trigger the Dutch interface of Wikidata. And then

96
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,920
you will see all these texts here. Those are all in Dutch. You can also do it in Portuguese,

97
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:03,640
and even in Japanese. Most of the items here are also available in Japanese, as you can see here.

98
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:13,320
All right, that was the first three. The fourth thing is that on Wikidata, that it contains

99
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:20,200
linked data. And how do I explain this? The phrase that you use is linked data is about

100
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,720
things, not strings. And it is made clear by looking at, for instance,

101
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,120
after whom the Eiffel Tower was named, being Gustav Eiffel. And this text you see here,

102
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,440
Gustav Eiffel, that's not plain text, but it's actually a URL you can click on. It's a clickable

103
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:48,680
link. And when you click on this link, you will go to the Wikidata item on Gustav Eiffel. And in

104
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,400
Gustav Eiffel, there are the other blue links, as you can see here, that use a human, etc. You can

105
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,480
also click on those, and then you'll go to the Wikidata items on, in this case, human.

106
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:08,200
This is meant by, so these are all entities in semantic terms, and not just ordinary strings.

107
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,760
These are mutually interconnected, as will be clear from this example. So there are like a

108
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,840
billion and billions of connections between all the items in Wikidata. So it's strongly internally

109
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,880
connected. But also Wikidata is strongly connected to the outside world, because in this case, for

110
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,160
the Eiffel Tower, these are all databases you see here, in which the Eiffel Tower is also described.

111
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,520
And if you, for instance, look at this one, the Skyscraper Center Building ID, and if you click

112
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,880
on this identifier in that particular database, you will get a description of the Eiffel Tower

113
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,960
in this database. Currently, there are over 9,000 different databases known to Wikidata.

114
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,640
So in theory, it's not the case, but provided they would all have an item on the Eiffel Tower,

115
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:08,120
this list of external databases would be 9,000 rows long. But that's just an illustration of

116
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,000
how many databases are actually available in Wikidata.

117
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:21,800
Okay, number five, Wikidata is free and open. And what do I mean by free? Free is as in gratis,

118
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:28,680
as in you don't have to pay money for it. And open is free. So you can go to the website,

119
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:36,440
pay money for it, to access it. Also, there are no trackers, like cookies and stuff in Wikidata.

120
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:45,720
And you will never see an ad that you have to avoid or click on. Because Wikidata is actually

121
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:54,280
under the same funding as Wikipedia. It's financed by getting annual donations from

122
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:04,920
about 7 million people from all over the world. Also, what is also defined by the word open here

123
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,120
is that the fact that in Wikidata, all the data is free of copyright and also free of database rights.

124
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:19,640
And that's because all the data in Wikidata is under the CC0 license. Effectively, this means

125
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:28,280
that all the data is dedicated into the public domain. This has two big consequences, this

126
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:35,720
principle that it is open. First of all, everybody is allowed to reuse the data in Wikidata. So you

127
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,280
can search it, you can share it, you can copy data, you can actually download all of Wikidata

128
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,400
and sell that as a commercial product. That's fully allowed because it's all in the public domain.

129
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:58,840
Secondly, the open nature of Wikidata also means that everybody can contribute data. Everybody can

130
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:06,840
add data, everybody can improve data, they can join two similar items, they can delete items, they can

131
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,400
add other kinds of information to Wikidata. And if you think that's true, there are actually a lot of

132
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,120
people that like doing that. Personally, I'm quite fond of adding new data to Wikidata.

133
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,560
And I'm not the only one in the world, because there is a strong Wikidata community.

134
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:37,560
And there are about 23,000 people on the planet that work on Wikidata at least once a week,

135
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:46,040
that's meant by active contributors. Of which I am one. So I have, you could also say that I have

136
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:56,360
23,000 colleagues all over the world, which I can reach out to if I need any help, or if I can,

137
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:05,720
if I also can give knowledge and my time and my knowledge about Wikidata, I can give them to them.

138
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,080
And what you also see on the background, I will come back to this later in a bit more detail,

139
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:16,840
but these people, they really like to meet each other, because I think every week or so, and

140
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:23,160
perhaps more often, somewhere in the world, there is a gathering of people working on Wikidata.

141
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,080
So this is an international bunch of people, really ranging from here, this is the Netherlands,

142
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,080
this was in Haiti, this was in Nigeria, if I remember correctly, this was in Nepal, I guess.

143
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:45,880
So a really international crowd, and I think the community is the unique selling point of Wikidata.

144
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:54,840
And why do I think so? In the previous slide I told that you can, in principle, you can download

145
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,440
Wikidata fully, the full database, and you can try to build a commercial product around it.

146
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,760
That's actually, I guess, not a totally unachievable task, it's a doable effort,

147
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,720
but what you don't, what you can't buy with money is the commitment and the time and the enthusiasm

148
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,560
and even the love of people for Wikidata. You can't buy these 23,000 people to actually come

149
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,440
and work at your new commercial version of Wikidata. And this is actually, I think, the

150
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,520
unique part of Wikidata, that there is this community that is really enthusiastic about

151
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,560
Wikidata, is helping each other all the time, it's global, it's very open, very friendly people,

152
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:50,200
which money simply can't buy. And more about the Wikidata community later in this presentation.

153
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:58,440
Okay, and the final guiding principle of Wikidata is number seven. This has to do with the fact that

154
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,160
Wikidata is both for humans. You can have, as a human, you can have an interaction with Wikidata

155
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:12,680
via the web interface of Wikidata. So you can read this stuff, but you can also change it and edit it,

156
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,840
and you can merge it, etc. And all these kind of operations you can do via the graphical user

157
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:27,640
interface, typically associated with HTML. But if you're a machine, or if somebody actually writes

158
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,240
a script to have machine interaction with Wikidata, that's also fully possible, because all

159
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:41,160
the things you can do via the graphical user interface, you can also do via a set of APIs.

160
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,240
So these are actually fully equivalent. If you can, everything you can do here, you can also do

161
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:59,000
programmatically via the API. All right, so far for the first two items on the agenda of this

162
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,640
theoretical part. What I would like to do next is to have a look at how things are actually

163
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:15,720
described in Wikidata. All right, so let's look at how things are described in Wikidata.

164
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:23,480
And this is always the classical image that is also available on the front page of the Wikidata

165
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,960
website. To illustrate this principle, we have this thing, in this case the Earth, and this has this

166
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,840
property, in this case the highest point. And this property has a value, and in this case it's

167
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:47,560
Mount Everest. And in Wikidata terms, it goes as follows. The Earth, which is Q2, and this Q-number

168
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,120
in Wikidata, that's a unique identifier of the thing that is being described. So apparently,

169
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,360
the Earth was the second thing ever to be described in Wikidata. Q1 is the universe, Q42 is

170
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:11,000
Douglas Adams, of course, all the way up to Q114 million at the moment. And this is just a number

171
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,120
that goes up every time a new Wikidata item is created. This Q2 has this property, highest point.

172
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,760
So this is this Q2 thing again, sorry. And this has this highest point, which is a property

173
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,840
in Wikidata, denoted by the P-number here. And this is apparently the 610th property that was

174
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:43,240
ever recorded in Wikidata. And the value of the thing is here, the Q-number for Mount Everest,

175
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,280
actually hidden by my little camera here. But this is, I can't read the Q-number actually,

176
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,480
but this is a Q-number. So it's always Q-P-Q, hence the Q, so like this,

177
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:05,720
actually the classical semantical triple. So let's illustrate that a bit further by looking at

178
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,840
the item of the KB in Wikidata. And the KB has this unique identifier. So that is the

179
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,480
unique Q-number by which the National Library of Netherlands is identified.

180
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,880
And this block on top, that's called the fingerprint in Wikidata terms.

181
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,800
This is multilingual. As you can see, there is a description in English, in German, in Spanish,

182
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:40,680
etc., also in Dutch, of course. And this has these fields of a label. So this is the title of the

183
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:47,320
item. And this is also reflected here. So if I were to change this, then this would change.

184
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,480
A little description, so a short characterization of what the thing is. This is the National

185
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,080
Library of the Netherlands. And here are these aliases, also known as alternative names,

186
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,760
by which this particular item is known, like the KB or the Royal Library, etc.

187
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,880
Next, if you scroll down that item page, then you will see that there is a claim made about

188
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,840
the country in which the National Library is. So this is again the same Q-P-Q triple. So it's

189
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:29,800
the KB, Q-number, this number. The country is identified by property 17 in Wikidata.

190
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:38,680
And the value of this property is it's in the Netherlands, which has number Q55.

191
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,600
And the place where this information comes from, the source reference, is listed as in this block.

192
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,920
This is called the reference. And it says, well, the claim that the KB is in the Netherlands is

193
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,640
drawn from this website, which was published in December 2019.

194
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,560
And this information was retrieved on this, the 12th of December,

195
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:11,800
2021. Everything that is in Wikidata should have a source reference. You can also see it here,

196
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:18,040
for instance, this claim has a reference, this has a reference, this not yet. But if you're

197
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:25,560
working on Wikidata, always try to add references to where you found the information that is being

198
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:32,840
given in the item. Then if you scroll down, you will see that there is a claim that the

199
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:47,720
KB is a member of a range of library associations. And if you look at this one, it's the KB is a member of the Conference of European National Librarians.

200
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:56,200
And in this bit, point in time 2022, so this claim was true in this year, this refinement,

201
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,080
that's called a qualifier. So qualifier is always the thing that refines the

202
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:15,560
how do you call that? The upper general, more general statement.

203
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:25,000
And finally, there is a list of external identifiers, just the same as I showed you with

204
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:35,160
the Eiffel Tower. And so these are all claims about the National Library. Okay, I actually

205
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:43,960
already mentioned that currently there are 9,000 over 9,000, to be said 9,045 different databases

206
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,040
known to Wikidata. And all these databases have their own properties. As you can see here,

207
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,520
these are all P numbers. So these all have their own properties. And actually, this is one of the

208
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,000
major functions of Wikidata is to be a hub on the internet to connect all kinds of databases

209
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,360
together. And I don't know any other registry or any other big place where so many different

210
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:18,520
databases are recorded. So if you want to discover obscure databases that you will never have heard

211
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:26,520
of before, Wikidata is the place to go to. If you just go to this and you check them out, you will

212
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:37,480
be amazed what kind of data is recorded in the world. And if you want to check out this information

213
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,520
in a bit more relaxed or laid-back manner, you can go to this page. This is a page on the

214
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,560
simplified data model of Wikidata. Basically, here is the same information as I just explained

215
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:59,560
to you is available, but you can read it at your own pace. And one thing I need to point out is

216
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:08,120
the following, that Wikidata has a version history. And this means that every edit that is stored

217
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:16,520
is stored forever. So everything you do in Wikidata is recorded. And you can always go back to previous

218
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:25,160
versions of the document and make sure that you don't put anything in Wikidata that is private

219
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:35,000
or secret. Because once it's in Wikidata, it is public forever. So be careful about what you add

220
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:47,240
to Wikidata. All right. Now let's look at some examples of what kind of information can be

221
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:54,440
requested from Wikidata. And I'm going to build it on three slides we saw before. The fact that

222
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,160
all the data in Wikidata is stored centrally. That it has all kinds of things, Wikidata,

223
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:09,240
and that everything is interconnected. Those three things, if you combine them together,

224
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,600
centrally stored, all sorts of things and everything is connected, you can ask really

225
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,600
interesting questions to Wikidata. If you want to ask questions to Wikidata, you do that via

226
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:27,720
a search language which is called SPARQL. It's like a dialect of SQL. And this is a common search

227
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,760
language for linked open databases. I'm not going to go into detail on SPARQL. That's an entire

228
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,560
day in itself, I guess. I can give workshops and lectures on that as well. But it's far

229
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:49,720
beyond the scope of this introductory workshop we're doing at the moment. But what I would like

230
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,360
to do now is to look at some results that you can get from SPARQLing in Wikidata. For instance,

231
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:04,440
you can ask Wikidata, give me some depictions of house cats and you will get up this result.

232
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:12,440
And if you click on this link, it will trigger this gallery, this depiction gallery.

233
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,480
You can also ask Wikidata, give me a list of things that are named after French presidents,

234
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,080
but which are outside of France. And you will, for instance, discover that in

235
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,680
Ivory Coast, apparently there is a bridge named after General De Gaulle. You can really make

236
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:41,720
interesting discoveries. And in Poland, there's also a roundabout called, of course, named after

237
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:50,760
Charles De Gaulle, etc. Or you can ask, give me a list of the causes of death of American presidents.

238
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:59,960
Or you can say, man, Nobel Prizes were awarded last week. And I wanted to know, well, who were

239
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,680
Dutch people that were nominated for a Nobel Prize, but actually never won the prize?

240
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,520
You get this list and you see that the Dutch author of Simon Vesdijk, he was nominated 11

241
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:19,080
times for the Nobel Prize, but he never won it. That's quite sad. But if you think,

242
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:26,440
Simon Vesdijk is a sad guy, think again, because this guy, Johannes Willem Sommerfeld,

243
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:36,120
he was nominated no fewer than 84 times for the Nobel Prize, but he never won it. And, yeah,

244
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:42,760
the cruel thing is that all of his PhD students, of like, like, 10, I believe 10 or so of his PhD

245
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:51,640
students, were actually winners of Nobel Prizes. But the man himself never won it, I'm afraid.

246
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:00,200
This is also a really nice query to show you the power of Wikidata paintings with alliterative

247
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:09,400
titles. I think about, for instance, like, what was it, an Apollo artist,

248
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,200
Cesar Chechime, so all alliterations.

249
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,280
10 largest cities with female mayors, you can also request that these are the cities,

250
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:29,240
these are the populations, and these are the female mayors. And finally, you can request a list

251
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:37,080
of birthplaces of economists that already died, divided by time period. So these are the time

252
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,920
periods, and the different colors represent each one, one time period here. And these are the

253
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:49,640
places where these economists, these already deceased economists were actually born.

254
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,920
Okay, this is to show you the power of Wikidata, basically. And now for the next block,

255
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:07,800
I would like to look at the things we saw before, all quite, let's call it more technical,

256
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:15,240
more data aspects of Wikidata. And I would like to have a also look at the social slash community

257
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,000
aspects of Wikidata. And this, if you ask this question, who builds Wikidata?

258
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,200
Then the answer is the community, because it's a community project.

259
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:34,440
And here on this slide, you see a roughly 1% of all the people in the world that's working

260
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,720
on Wikidata. And what I already told actually is that there are currently 23,000 active contributors

261
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:50,280
to Wikidata. And it has been in existence since October 2012. So currently we're celebrating the

262
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:57,720
12th birthday of Wikidata. And since that time, they have made 2.25 billion edits, which is an

263
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:06,600
awful lot. These people don't only like to work on Wikidata as a data thing, but they also,

264
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:14,200
as you can see from this group, they like to meet each other. And when you become active

265
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:21,560
in the Wikidata community, as I said, you like to meet each other, but you also will,

266
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,080
by experience, be drawn to certain roles or certain tasks within the community

267
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:36,920
that you like more than others. And here you can see a number of roles that are

268
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,000
present in the Wikidata community. It can be a developer, or it can be an ambassador,

269
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,080
or it can be a translator. And when you look at a somewhat larger list of different roles you can

270
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,080
fulfill within the community, you will see that there are, this is not a hard division, but

271
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:10,600
I try to group the more hard data roles, like being a developer, or data editor, or data modeler,

272
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:19,640
or a SPARQL expert, here above the line here. But the nice thing about Wikidata is also that there

273
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:26,760
are lots of roles you can have in the community that are not really about hard data, but like,

274
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:33,960
you can translate in data in Wikidata, or you can be an event organizer. So all these events that

275
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,880
take place all over the world with subgroups of the Wikidata community, these are all organized

276
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,400
by those people themselves. So you can also, if you like organizing events, you can become a member

277
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:52,680
of the Wikidata community. Or you can do communication and outreach, or what I'm doing right now at this

278
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,000
moment, I can be a teacher, a trainer, and a speaker. This is also a role you can have

279
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:05,960
in the Wikidata community. So for every type of job role, there's always a place for you within

280
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:17,000
Wikidata. And another thing to shed another light on the community is the following. I asked

281
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:25,000
ChatGPT last week, what can you tell me about the mindset behind the Wikidata community?

282
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:32,680
And it came up with this really great answer. This was spot on, so I just copied it. I didn't

283
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,640
try to paraphrase it in any way. It's all about openness and transparency. It's about

284
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,800
collaboration and collective intelligence, the wisdom of the crowd here. It's about inclusivity

285
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:52,760
and diversity. Everybody is welcome from all over the world, independent of country, sexual

286
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,280
preference, education, etc. You're all very welcome, independent of culture, language,

287
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:07,560
expertise, etc. It's all about innovation and experimentation. It's about a strong culture of

288
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:18,040
experimentation, which is exactly how I personally like to work. I like to experiment with stuff.

289
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:26,440
It's about supportive collective learning, and it's about having an impact on the entire planet.

290
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,920
It's a global database. It's a global project. And this is also in the mind of people working

291
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,440
on Wikidata, that you're not doing this for your own institution or your own country even, but it's

292
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:50,600
really geared towards the entire world. This also means, this community sense, is that people like

293
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,480
to meet each other, as I already said, and it really happens all over the world. These are all

294
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:03,560
images of celebrations of Wikidata birthdays in the past, and you see it's from Indonesia, India,

295
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:11,640
Nepal, Germany, Netherlands, Turkey, etc. So it's a really global community.

296
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,680
Once every year, on average, there is this big international meetup of people that like Wikidata.

297
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,000
This is called WikidataCon. And here you can meet people from all over the world that are

298
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:39,320
working and are enthusiastic about Wikidata. And one of the events that takes place right now,

299
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:45,320
this month, is the birthday celebration of Wikidata. Currently we do the 12th birthday.

300
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,440
And people, they come together, they really celebrate Wikidata, they bake cakes with the

301
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,600
Wikidata logo on it, and they have their favorite t-shirts on. And it's really, you see, quite

302
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:08,760
literally all over the world, Wikidata is being celebrated. Also, throughout the year, many

303
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,720
Wikidata workshops are giving, introduction workshops, as I'm doing at the moment here right now,

304
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:20,680
but also more advanced workshops are also given, or more specialized technical meetups,

305
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:29,320
like hackathons and editathons, they're also happening quite often. And as a good community,

306
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,160
of course, you have your community swag, you have your t-shirts and your caps and your

307
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,840
breadcases and your brooms and your pens, etc. And this is me personally wearing my Wikidata t-shirts,

308
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:50,200
etc. It says stickers, of course, to put on your laptops. This is also a manifestation of the

309
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:59,720
fandom that many people have about Wikidata. So I hope this little section gave you some feeling

310
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,640
of the human side of Wikidata, I think I call it that way, the social and community aspects

311
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:15,560
which makes Wikidata such a nice place. Okay, then I've arrived at the last part of my,

312
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,760
this particular presentation, this talk. And this talk, this part is to do with

313
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,240
illustrating how Wikidata can be relevant for research, science and cultural heritage.

314
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:38,360
And this is actually a section I made especially for this workshop, this lecture.

315
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:47,320
So let's find out what it is. I think this section will take about 15 to 20 minutes.

316
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:57,480
So then we'll have a full hour of presentation done. This is not much time, 15 to 20 minutes is

317
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,920
not a lot of time to actually talk about this topic. So as you will see, this section will be

318
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,760
quite anecdotic. It's not a concise treatment of all the various aspects of Wikidata has

319
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,040
in relation to research, science and cultural heritage. But it's like, I will bring forward

320
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:24,280
a number of use cases which hopefully will illustrate this sentence here in a nice way.

321
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,680
And when I was thinking how shall I introduce this part of the presentation,

322
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,440
I thought the following. My line of thought was as follows. In this slide that we saw before,

323
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,080
you see actually that Wikidata holds data about many fields of science and research,

324
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:52,360
like chemistry, astronomy, genetic sciences, scientific articles, biology and stuff,

325
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:59,000
and et cetera here. And what I thought, well, actually, I don't need to talk about

326
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:06,680
what Wikidata holds for science, but the other way around, what science holds for Wikidata.

327
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:15,560
So I looked up a visual representation of all of human knowledge. These are all fields of

328
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:22,440
human knowledge, as you can see. And I asked myself the question, to what extent is Wikidata

329
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:32,120
used throughout science research and GLAM / cultural heritage? And actually,

330
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,240
I didn't have an immediate answer to that. So I tried searching academic databases,

331
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,080
looking for articles on Wikidata, and then plot them on certain fields of knowledge.

332
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:53,160
And this was not immediately an easy exercise until I found this website. You can see here at

333
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,240
the very bottom of the slide, it's called SemanticScholar.org. This is a service that you can

334
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,560
search over 200 million scientific articles with. And if you do this query, you can look for

335
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,000
articles that are related to Wikidata. And the nice thing about SemanticScholar is that you can

336
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:18,760
filter on fields of study. And this is what I did to get an overview of this. And then I found out

337
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:27,640
that Wikidata is used in the area of gender studies, and also on history and linguistics,

338
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:37,400
and geography and sociology and information science, art, astronomy, biology and microbiology,

339
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,200
computer science, medicine, environmental sciences, and even in ecology.

340
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:59,800
So it's certainly not a full, not every domain of human knowledge is represented via Wikidata,

341
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,920
but quite a few. And I also think that increasingly, because I think if you did

342
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,200
that exercise 10 years ago, you would have far less white bins here. So increasingly,

343
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:18,040
you Wikidata shows its relevance for increasingly more fields of knowledge.

344
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:27,960
And what I would like to do now is to look at six case studies, six anecdotal cases. And

345
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,880
there's a little point, of course, I did it anecdotally, because it's about Wikidata.

346
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:39,080
And look at six use cases, which hopefully show or at least illustrate

347
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,840
how Wikidata can be relevant for that particular field of science.

348
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:56,040
And the first case study, the first case I would like to bring forward has to do with

349
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,400
the field of scholarly communication or scientometrics. And scientometrics is the

350
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,880
quantitative study of science and scientific communication. So for instance, if you want to

351
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:18,040
know who is the most cited author in a certain field of science, or the most prolific journals

352
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:24,840
in a certain field, that's the things that are being studied in scientometrics.

353
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:32,280
And a really nice scientometric tool is Scholia. And what's Scholia? Scholia is a service that

354
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,760
creates visual scholarly profiles for researchers, articles, organizations, etc.,

355
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:50,120
all based on information from Wikidata. And I need to illustrate this, of course,

356
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,120
otherwise it will be a bit abstract. And the first profile that I would like to show you is

357
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,480
the profile from this professor here at Maastricht University, Gerard van Breukelen.

358
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:10,920
And this is a Scholia profile of Gerard. And if you go to this profile, what kind of things will

359
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:17,480
you actually encounter? First of all, there's a list of publications. So where he was the author

360
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:26,040
or one of the co-authors of the article. I have to be specific, these are not necessarily

361
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,920
all the articles that Gerard published, because these are only the articles that are recorded

362
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:40,200
in Wikidata. And I'm not sure if Wikidata has a complete inventory of all of his articles.

363
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,800
But for the articles that are available, you can make this list. You can also make this plot,

364
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:52,440
like how many articles he published over the years, either as the main author or one of the

365
00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:04,280
co-authors or as a lower rank author. You can see by this, how I call it, bubble chart,

366
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:12,200
it's called what kind of research topics Gerard van Breukelen is involved in, and also in which

367
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:22,360
journals he published most. The bigger ones are the most often, I'm sorry, the journals he used

368
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:28,520
most often for his publications, and the smaller ones are the less used journals.

369
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:38,520
This is a graph of the co-authors, so the people who Gerard van Breukelen collaborated with in

370
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:45,560
writing his articles. And you can also see where these co-authors work across the globe by this

371
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:54,200
co-author map. And finally, you can also check out which articles by Gerard van Breukelen were

372
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:01,720
cited most often. And apparently this ANCOPA paper was cited 206 times. And of course,

373
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:09,720
you can also give the number of citations over the years. So this is how such a profile on

374
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:19,720
Scholia is composed. And the nice thing about Scholia is that you cannot only request these

375
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:27,720
profiles for authors, for people, but also for organizations or for articles or for journals or

376
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:36,840
for topics like obesity or for taxons like the Mosasaurus or chemical elements. These are all

377
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:44,360
possible, so you can have all these really nice ways to have various facets and spotlights on all

378
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:56,280
sorts of, let's say, classes of information. If you want to read more about Scholia, I can

379
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:03,320
recommend the base paper of Scholia where the project is introduced.

380
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:13,320
This one. And if you want to read on Wikidata about Scholia, you can go to the Scholia page on Wikidata.

381
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:22,040
Okay, the second one, the second field of science and research I would like to bring forward is

382
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:32,280
life and biomedical sciences. And I'm mainly doing this because the author of this particular paper,

383
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:39,320
Andra Waagmeester, is also a very active community member of Wikidata. So I know him

384
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:48,840
more from the Wikidata community than from this particular field. And I must be honest, I'm a bit

385
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:57,240
anxious. I'm holding my horses, let's say. I'm a bit anxious. That's too strong. But I'm not

386
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:05,080
very familiar in this field of knowledge. So I'm not going to talk about this in too much detail.

387
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,160
But what I would like to forward is that in this paper,

388
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:18,120
Wikidata is being discussed as a knowledge graph for the life sciences. And this paper demonstrates

389
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,240
several use cases of Wikidata, including crowdsource creation of biomedical ontologies,

390
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:31,320
phenotype-based diagnosis of disease. I have no idea what this means, but I'll just take it for

391
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:36,200
granted that some of you might know it. And drug repurposing. And if you want to read the full

392
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:46,040
article, of course, you can go here. Another article by Andra Waagmeester is this one. This

393
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:55,720
has to do with aligning knowledge surrounding corona viruses. When the pandemic struck,

394
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:02,760
it said here that there were a lot of projects and initiatives that rose up in the beta corner.

395
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:11,320
And these were all very loosely related. And there was a need to have a common ground to bring

396
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:18,840
together all these different projects. And in this paper, Wikidata is suggested as such a common

397
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:29,320
ground. So this is used to make data sources related to human corona viruses more interoperable.

398
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:37,400
So these are two papers by Andra Waagmeester. Actually, he took it a step further and he did

399
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:51,240
a PhD on biomedical sciences and Wikidata. Not exactly, but this PhD of his, which he defended

400
00:50:51,960 --> 00:51:00,360
successfully earlier this year in January, it has a lot of Wikidata in it. I counted it and it has

401
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:09,800
415 mentions of Wikidata. I think this is the most Wikidata dense PhD thesis, perhaps,

402
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,680
for sure in this field of science. And I think perhaps in the Netherlands, perhaps even worldwide,

403
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,520
this is Wikidata is very prominent in this particular PhD.

404
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:34,600
This is another article on biological taxonomy. For reasons of time, I'm not going to

405
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,080
detail it. I'm not going to talk about it. Actually, I'm just showing it to you.

406
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:46,520
Of course, this presentation is also available as a PowerPoint and as a PDF file. And there's also a

407
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,880
full text version of this presentation where you can find the link to this particular article.

408
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,160
If you want to study it yourself, you can do it after this presentation.

409
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,160
And then the third field that I would like to bring forward is this one,

410
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:12,200
astronomy. And this is, let's say, the mirror opposite of life sciences, because

411
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,040
that's actually the topic I studied. I studied astronomy in the 90s in Leiden.

412
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:24,760
So I'm much more familiar with the type of information you see here than the type of

413
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:31,800
information you saw on the previous slides. So I was really happy to find a paper that mentions

414
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:41,960
Wikidata in relation to astronomy. And this paper talks about using Wikidata to disambiguate

415
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:48,120
planetary features. And what are planetary features? Excuse me, in this context.

416
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:57,240
Think, for instance, of craters on the moon and craters on Mars that carry the same name.

417
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,520
So if you have a paper, if you have an astronomical publication, and you want to do

418
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:09,960
named entity recognition on that paper, and you would encounter, for instance, I think it's called

419
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Adams here, the crater is called Adams, you're not sure if that crater is situated on the moon,

420
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:27,640
or if it's situated on Mars. To make that process easier, this paper suggests that Wikidata can be

421
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:35,240
used for extracting planetary names, and to make that named entity recognition process and this

422
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,640
disambiguation process of planetary features more easily.

423
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:48,680
Another thing about astronomy, this is also, I'm just going to show you this, I'm not going to

424
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,920
discuss it, but you can study it yourself afterwards if you're interested.

425
00:53:54,520 --> 00:54:00,120
Because I would like to move on to the next, the fourth case study on using Wikidata.

426
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,840
And this has to do with a very hot topic at the moment, large language models and

427
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:12,520
artificial intelligence. And this paper talks about using Wikidata to make large language

428
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:19,880
models more accurate and flexible. Here it says that all the facts that are stated in Wikidata,

429
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:27,720
some 12 billion, they can be used to train large language models to provide more accurate answers.

430
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:35,080
And the other way around is also true. This paper talks about using artificial intelligence and LLMs

431
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:43,240
to improve the contents of Wikidata. And you might notice in Wikidata that some fields are empty,

432
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:48,600
for instance, that not all fields have been fulfilled, or that certain languages in Wikidata

433
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:56,440
are underrepresented. And this paper suggests that artificial intelligence could build,

434
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:08,920
could fill those kinds of current gaps. This is another paper on AI and LLMs related to Wikidata,

435
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,960
but as with the previous two other papers that I skipped, I will also skip this one

436
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:19,800
for reasons of time. So if you're interested in that, yeah, you can study it yourself.

437
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:28,840
Because what I would like to spend the last five remaining minutes on of this talk is this one.

438
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:35,720
This is a case study from my own library, from the KB. And this has to do with GLAM and cultural

439
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:43,160
heritage. And the thing about the KB is that we have this really nice collection of what we call

440
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:49,240
our collection highlights. We have really wonderful manuscripts and old atlases and these really

441
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:57,320
lovely, hand-illustrated books about birds of the Netherlands from the 18th century, basically.

442
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:06,120
And we have about 80 of these most beautiful and important objects of our collection.

443
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,360
These are our collection highlights. And these are all part of our national heritage.

444
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:19,720
And when you look at the way that we make these collection highlights available through our own

445
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:28,280
websites, like our own KB website, but also our catalog, and the way we show the fully digitized

446
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:34,520
works, you will notice that they are really good to look at and to read. You can, for instance,

447
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,720
read about all these collection highlights on our own websites. You can all find them in our catalogs.

448
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:45,640
And we have these books you can leaf through with all the digitized images of all these

449
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:54,040
80 collection highlights. And the metaphor is that you can view them and you can see them and

450
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,080
you can read them, but you can't touch them. And what do I mean by you can't touch them?

451
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:06,360
Is that if you actually want to build stuff, you want to use these collection highlights as

452
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,800
building blocks, if you want to create something from these collection highlights, then our own

453
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:18,200
web services are not very suitable. And what do we have to think? If I say build stuff,

454
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:24,680
then like you say you want to make visualizations based on our collection highlights, or you want

455
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:30,360
to build apps that contain collection highlights, or you want to make data stories, or you want to

456
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:38,520
do AI stuff, or you want to build tools, etc. or games you want to use, you want to make a game

457
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:44,360
of our collection highlights, or offline you want to do a publication, or you want to do an artwork

458
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:52,440
on these collection highlights, then our own website and our own catalog are not really

459
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:59,560
suitable for that. It's not a place that offers building blocks. So if you think that idea through,

460
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,400
what you actually would like to have is something like that. You would like your collections

461
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:13,400
highlights to be some kind of a technical Lego set that contains building blocks with which you

462
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:20,280
can make all these things I just showed you. And if you look at this slide, it's no coincidence

463
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:31,400
that this Lego box is powered by Wikidata and also Commons and Wikipedia.

464
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:39,480
And how do you need to see this? This is about what I've called Wikifying our collection highlights.

465
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:46,120
So what we made sure we did a project on that in 2020. And we made sure that our collection

466
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:55,640
highlights were all described on Wikidata. And also subsets or deeper level Wikidata items

467
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:02,200
regarding those highlights were made. Next, we made sure that all the 11,000 images we had

468
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:08,520
from our KB collection highlights were available on Wikimedia Commons. And we made sure that most

469
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:15,720
highlights got Wikipedia articles. And I've summarized that process of turning our collection

470
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:22,440
highlights into Wiki building blocks. I call that Wikifying. And once you start Wikifying your

471
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:30,120
collections, then you will be able, you will get all kinds of new functionalities that you

472
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,480
can now do with your collection highlights that were not possible before.

473
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:47,720
Perhaps this is a bit abstract, but I invite you to read a five series paper that I wrote about this.

474
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:54,920
50 cool things that you can now do with KB collection highlights. And these, the first part

475
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:01,880
is a general introduction for why we did the project and how we Wikified our collection highlights.

476
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:10,520
And then in the four next episodes of this series, in roughly, let's say 12 new functionalities per

477
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:18,680
article, you can discover what kind of new things we can now do with our collection highlights,

478
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:24,120
because our collection highlights are now available in the Wikimedia infrastructure.

479
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,280
This is a really nice article that I really would like to encourage you to read it.

480
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,840
And then the last example that I would like to show you

481
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:43,160
is this one. This is from the American Physical Society. So that's the

482
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:50,440
organization that supports physicists in the United States. And they provide these trainings

483
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:58,440
that aim at elevating the achievements of women and other underrepresented groups via Wikipedia

484
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:07,800
and via Wikidata. The American Physical Society has such an initiative.

485
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,760
A similar initiative is done by the Smithsonian Institutions in Washington.

486
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:23,080
And they want to improve the representation of women in science, technology, engineering and math

487
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:30,440
by working on Wikipedia articles to improve those and create those for more female scientists

488
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:38,120
and also do that simultaneously on Wikidata. And if you get better information in Wikipedia,

489
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:46,040
you get better info boxes. Here this is a Wikipedia info box. And then in Google search results,

490
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:52,360
which is based on this info box, the information here will also be visible better.

491
01:01:53,080 --> 01:02:00,360
So by working on Wikidata and Wikipedia, eventually Google will also be improved.

492
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,560
And if you want to read more about this, these were just six case studies where I highlighted

493
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:17,960
a number of papers. If you want to read more papers on science and Wikidata, you can go to

494
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:25,160
the little list I compiled here for you. It's various Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar that

495
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:33,320
I talked about before. And you can look for Wikidata articles yourself. Okay, this is pretty

496
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:43,240
much the end of my talk. Nearly finished. What I would like to show you before I really finish is

497
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:50,840
where you can find this presentation on Zenodo. If you go to this record on Zenodo,

498
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
then you can either download this presentation as a PowerPoint or a PDF.

499
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:12,200
And if you want to discover Wikidata further, because I was only able to show you a really

500
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:18,920
small part actually of all the knowledge related to Wikidata, you can go to this page on GitHub,

501
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:26,440
the Wikidata General Overview. And this is kind of a comprehensive introduction into Wikidata,

502
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:33,880
but quite compact. I tried to squeeze as much information on the basic level about Wikidata

503
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:42,920
into a big list. It's a big inventory of mainly links to other places for Wikidata.

504
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:51,160
I think this is a really good general introduction, general overview of Wikidata if you're relatively

505
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:59,640
new to Wikidata. Okay, that was my presentation. That was my talk. Thank you for your attention.

506
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:07,160
If you have any questions or any suggestions, please reach out to me. The preferred way is via

507
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:13,400
email here. This is my email address at the National Library. You can find all the information

508
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:21,720
here on Zenodo. And I would like to know if you send me an email. If you want to know more, we can

509
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:29,000
get in contact further. Okay, that was it for me. Bye bye. And I'll see you in the second part of

510
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,680
the presentation, or the second part of the workshop, which is the practical, hands-on part

511
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:40,760
of the workshop. And this is available in a separate video, which is also available from

512
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,680
Zenodo in due time. Bye bye.
