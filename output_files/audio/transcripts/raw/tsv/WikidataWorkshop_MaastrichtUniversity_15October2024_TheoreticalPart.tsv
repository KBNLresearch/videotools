0	9120	Hello everybody, welcome to this workshop on Wikidata for the University of Maastricht
9120	17440	on the 15th of October 2024. My name is Olaf, I'm the Wikimedia Coordinator at the National
17440	23560	Library of the Netherlands. And today, for the next two and a half hours, I will guide
23560	33360	this workshop on Wikidata related to professors here at Maastricht University. And this workshop
33360	40540	will be in two parts. It will be first a theoretical introduction where we will look at the basics
40540	49200	of Wikidata, so really the principles and founding guidances of Wikidata. And also in
49200	57440	the theoretical part we will look at how we can use Wikidata in research, science and
57440	63240	cultural heritage. That will be about an hour, so that will be me presenting the theory to
63240	69640	you. And of course, if you have any questions, you can send me an email or we can have a
69640	75800	chat if you would like to know more about that part of Wikidata. Then we have a short
75800	81920	break and after the break there will be a second theoretical part, so where you will actually try
81920	91560	to make your first edits and contributions to Wikidata, themed by data on professors of
91560	96840	Maastricht University. For the second part, there's actually a separate video available which
96840	104560	you will find on the page this video is in. I recorded it also today when it was still daylight.
104720	110400	So if you want to work through that workshop, the practical part of the workshop yourself,
110400	119520	then you can go and check out that video. And the second part is between 75 or 90 minutes,
119520	126520	but for this particular video that I'm recording now, I will actually only do the basics of Wikidata,
126680	137400	so that will be approximately an hour of video you will have had. So let me go on to the opening
137400	143400	slide of this theoretical part. As I said, I'm Olaf Janssen, I'm with the National Library of
143400	150360	the Netherlands. And for the next hour, we will look at the basics of Wikidata. So what Wikidata
150360	155960	is, what are the principles of Wikidata, both from the technical and social point of view,
155960	166840	and with social, I mean the community point of view. And then in the second part of this first
166840	173320	theoretical block, I will show you some case studies on how Wikidata can be relevant for
173320	180840	the domains of research, science and cultural heritage. Perhaps a small introduction about
180840	186280	myself. As I said, I'm with the National Library of the Netherlands, and I'm the Wikimedia
186280	192840	Coordinator of our library. And in that role, which I've been fulfilling for 10 years now,
193560	199640	I try to bring two worlds together. On the one hand, there is the world of the KB with our
199640	204280	collections and our data and our books, of course, and our information and our people.
205240	211800	And on the other hand, there is the world of Wikipedia, for instance, Encyclopedia, but also
211800	219560	projects like Wikidata that we'll discuss today, or the image repository of Wikipedia called
219560	227400	Wikimedia Commons. And the volunteers of creators, or sorry, the communities of creators, mostly
227400	234840	volunteers, that work on these platforms to sustain them and to grow them. In these two worlds,
234840	243000	I try to collaborate them together to mutual benefit. For instance, we as the KB take a lot
243000	250680	of information from Wikipedia, Wikidata, but also make sure that we contribute to Wikidata. And one
250680	257320	of the contributions that we also do, it's not only adding data to Wikidata, but also educating
257320	263960	other heritage institutions and other universities about Wikidata. This is exactly the thing that I'm
263960	270280	doing right now. So I'm sharing my knowledge with you and hopefully the wider Wikimedia community
272200	280760	just for mutual benefit, so to say. All right, so what do I hope that you will have
281480	287160	learned or gained some more understanding of by the end of this afternoon? First of all,
287800	293880	that you have a basic idea of what Wikidata is, how it works, both from the technical perspective,
293880	299880	like the data perspective, and also from the community slash social perspective. So that you
299880	307880	will also have a little insight in how the community around Wikidata is organized.
308840	313640	Because I put it here on purpose, because in many introductory talks about Wikidata,
313640	322520	it only focuses on this real hard data aspect of Wikidata. But for me, the community aspects are
323160	328520	equally important, actually. And actually, I think they're even more important than the technical
328520	333960	aspects of Wikidata. And why I think so, I will discuss later on in this presentation.
334280	343000	Then next, the second learning goal is trying to give you a small insight into how Wikidata can be
343000	351400	relevant for research, science, and cultural heritage. And then lastly, and this is the second
351400	359400	part of the workshop, the practical part, for which a separate video is available also, is trying to
359640	364760	guide you through making your first steps into Wikidata yourself. So doing your first contributions
365640	373640	focused on data of professors here at Maastricht University. So let's start simply by asking
373640	381480	ourselves, what is Wikidata? Well, if you talk with people about Wikidata, you get a wide variety
382200	391320	of answers. But depending on their view on Wikidata and their level of experience with
391320	399640	Wikidata, I think the most basic thing you can explain about Wikidata is that it is a database
400360	408360	containing structured descriptions of all sorts of things. And what kinds of things are,
409160	417320	can you think of, for instance, it as a description, a structured description of the Eiffel Tower,
417320	426040	or this valley in Antarctica, or this hit single by Girlfriend, or this book, or this American judge,
426600	434040	or this airport in the United States, or this gene, or this election in Catalonia,
434600	441560	or this scientific article, or this species of insect, or this composition by Robert Schumann,
441560	448280	or this street in the Netherlands, or this family name, or this quasar in the constellation of
448280	455160	Urza Meyer, or this really nice car, or this really nice metal band, or this international
455160	462840	football association, or this cannabis seed bank in Canada, or this researcher, or this randomly
462840	469160	chosen library from the Netherlands. So you see there are a lot of different things described in
469160	479400	Wikidata. In total, when I last checked it, nearly 114 million distinct things are described in
479400	487800	Wikidata. To give you just a short glimpse of what kind of groups together, like classes,
487800	493160	there are described in Wikidata. It has a lot of scientific articles to start with. This is the
493880	499640	the green pie chart. I will come back to that towards the end of my presentation, why it is
499640	506280	such a big chunk. But also there are roughly some 5 million people, 5 to 6 million people described
506280	513800	in Wikidata, animal and plants, etc. Chemical substances, thousands and thousands of
513800	520520	astronomical objects, genes, really a lot of genes are available in Wikidata, etc.
522520	528680	So Wikidata is both very broad, but it can also be very specific, like it has
529320	535080	currently nearly 900 descriptions of Van Gogh paintings.
536040	544040	If you take all the things in Wikidata that have geographical coordinates, like longitude
544920	550440	and latitude, and you plot them on a map, you get this map, which was last created a year ago.
551320	558120	Basically, this is a map of where people live, because where people live, they tend to describe
559080	565560	their things in their surroundings. And it's typically along the coast. You will see,
565560	575800	for instance, also this kind of map with other data points related to human civilization and
575800	582840	where humans live. Okay, so that was a really brief introduction into Wikidata, really basic.
582840	588440	What I would like to do next in the second part of the talk is to have a look at the principles
588440	599800	that are guiding Wikidata. And those are seven. And let me just start by the first one.
601480	607160	Wikidata contains structured descriptions of things. You can think, for instance, about
607800	614840	Wikipedia. Wikipedia also contains descriptions of things, but those descriptions are free text.
615720	622040	So they are not structured. And what do I mean by structured? It's the following, like there is,
622040	627880	for instance, the Eiffel Tower is described in Wikidata. And you can see here that the Eiffel
627880	634360	Tower is named after Gustave Eiffel. And it is situated in the country of France. And it is the
635320	641080	property of the government of France. And these are structured descriptions. So it's a
642520	649240	thing, the Eiffel Tower, and it has this property, which has a value here. And in this way,
649240	658040	the entire Wikidata item is structured. What you notice here is that this description of the Eiffel
658040	662120	Tower is in English. All the fields that you see here, all these strings and all these
662920	669400	things here, those are all in English. Why that's important, you will find out in a moment.
671320	679560	Then secondly, all these 140 million descriptions are stored in one big central system. At least
679560	684520	for the user, that is the experience. Behind the scenes, I think there will be multiple databases
684600	694600	working together. But for the user experience, it's one big storage of data. And data is not
694600	702040	available only in English, but in over 200 different languages. And that's why I just
702040	707240	showed you the English interface. You can also trigger the Dutch interface of Wikidata. And then
707240	714920	you will see all these texts here. Those are all in Dutch. You can also do it in Portuguese,
715720	723640	and even in Japanese. Most of the items here are also available in Japanese, as you can see here.
726120	733320	All right, that was the first three. The fourth thing is that on Wikidata, that it contains
733400	740200	linked data. And how do I explain this? The phrase that you use is linked data is about
740760	745720	things, not strings. And it is made clear by looking at, for instance,
747800	754120	after whom the Eiffel Tower was named, being Gustav Eiffel. And this text you see here,
754120	760440	Gustav Eiffel, that's not plain text, but it's actually a URL you can click on. It's a clickable
760440	768680	link. And when you click on this link, you will go to the Wikidata item on Gustav Eiffel. And in
768680	773400	Gustav Eiffel, there are the other blue links, as you can see here, that use a human, etc. You can
773400	779480	also click on those, and then you'll go to the Wikidata items on, in this case, human.
780280	788200	This is meant by, so these are all entities in semantic terms, and not just ordinary strings.
788760	794760	These are mutually interconnected, as will be clear from this example. So there are like a
794760	800840	billion and billions of connections between all the items in Wikidata. So it's strongly internally
800840	807880	connected. But also Wikidata is strongly connected to the outside world, because in this case, for
807880	815160	the Eiffel Tower, these are all databases you see here, in which the Eiffel Tower is also described.
816120	822520	And if you, for instance, look at this one, the skyscraper center building ID, and if you click
822520	827880	on this identifier in that particular database, you will get a description of the Eiffel Tower
827880	833960	in this database. Currently, there are over 9,000 different databases known to Wikidata.
833960	839640	So in theory, it's not the case, but provided they would all have an item on the Eiffel Tower,
839720	848120	this list of external databases would be 9,000 rows long. But that's just an illustration of
848120	851000	how many databases are actually available in Wikidata.
853240	861800	Okay, number five, Wikidata is free and open. And what do I mean by free? Free is as in gratis,
861800	868680	as in you don't have to pay money for it. And open is free. So you can go to the website,
868680	876440	pay money for it, to access it. Also, there are no trackers, like cookies and stuff in Wikidata.
876440	885720	And you will never see an ad that you have to avoid or click on. Because Wikidata is actually
885720	894280	under the same funding as Wikipedia. It's financed by getting annual donations from
894280	904920	about 7 million people from all over the world. Also, what is also defined by the word open here
904920	912120	is that the fact that in Wikidata, all the data is free of copyright and also free of database rights.
912120	919640	And that's because all the data in Wikidata is under the CC0 license. Effectively, this means
919640	928280	that all the data is dedicated into the public domain. This has two big consequences, this
928280	935720	principle that it is open. First of all, everybody is allowed to reuse the data in Wikidata. So you
935720	942280	can search it, you can share it, you can copy data, you can actually download all of Wikidata
942280	947400	and sell that as a commercial product. That's fully allowed because it's all in the public domain.
950600	958840	Secondly, the open nature of Wikidata also means that everybody can contribute data. Everybody can
958840	966840	add data, everybody can improve data, they can join two similar items, they can delete items, they can
967960	973400	add other kinds of information to Wikidata. And if you think that's true, there are actually a lot of
973480	980120	people that like doing that. Personally, I'm quite fond of adding new data to Wikidata.
981240	987560	And I'm not the only one in the world, because there is a strong Wikidata community.
989240	997560	And there are about 23,000 people on the planet that work on Wikidata at least once a week,
997560	1006040	that's meant by active contributors. Of which I am one. So I have, you could also say that I have
1006040	1016360	23,000 colleagues all over the world, which I can reach out to if I need any help, or if I can,
1016360	1025720	if I also can give knowledge and my time and my knowledge about Wikidata, I can give them to them.
1026280	1031080	And what you also see on the background, I will come back to this later in a bit more detail,
1031080	1036840	but these people, they really like to meet each other, because I think every week or so, and
1036840	1043160	perhaps more often, somewhere in the world, there is a gathering of people working on Wikidata.
1044520	1049080	So this is an international bunch of people, really ranging from here, this is the Netherlands,
1049080	1055080	this was in Haiti, this was in Nigeria, if I remember correctly, this was in Nepal, I guess.
1055800	1065880	So a really international crowd, and I think the community is the unique selling point of Wikidata.
1065880	1074840	And why do I think so? In the previous slide I told that you can, in principle, you can download
1074840	1080440	Wikidata fully, the full database, and you can try to build a commercial product around it.
1081080	1086760	That's actually, I guess, not a totally unachievable task, it's a doable effort,
1087320	1093720	but what you don't, what you can't buy with money is the commitment and the time and the enthusiasm
1093720	1101560	and even the love of people for Wikidata. You can't buy these 23,000 people to actually come
1101560	1106440	and work at your new commercial version of Wikidata. And this is actually, I think, the
1106440	1112520	unique part of Wikidata, that there is this community that is really enthusiastic about
1112520	1119560	Wikidata, is helping each other all the time, it's global, it's very open, very friendly people,
1120280	1130200	which money simply can't buy. And more about the Wikidata community later in this presentation.
1131160	1138440	Okay, and the final guiding principle of Wikidata is number seven. This has to do with the fact that
1138440	1145160	Wikidata is both for humans. You can have, as a human, you can have an interaction with Wikidata
1145160	1152680	via the web interface of Wikidata. So you can read this stuff, but you can also change it and edit it,
1152680	1158840	and you can merge it, etc. And all these kind of operations you can do via the graphical user
1158920	1167640	interface, typically associated with HTML. But if you're a machine, or if somebody actually writes
1167640	1173240	a script to have machine interaction with Wikidata, that's also fully possible, because all
1173240	1181160	the things you can do via the graphical user interface, you can also do via a set of APIs.
1181160	1187240	So these are actually fully equivalent. If you can, everything you can do here, you can also do
1187240	1199000	programmatically via the API. All right, so far for the first two items on the agenda of this
1199000	1205640	theoretical part. What I would like to do next is to have a look at how things are actually
1205640	1215720	described in Wikidata. All right, so let's look at how things are described in Wikidata.
1216040	1223480	And this is always the classical image that is also available on the front page of the Wikidata
1223480	1229960	website. To illustrate this principle, we have this thing, in this case the Earth, and this has this
1229960	1236840	property, in this case the highest point. And this property has a value, and in this case it's
1237800	1247560	Mount Everest. And in Wikidata terms, it goes as follows. The Earth, which is Q2, and this Q number
1247560	1254120	in Wikidata, that's a unique identifier of the thing that is being described. So apparently,
1256120	1262360	the Earth was the second thing ever to be described in Wikidata. Q1 is the universe, Q42 is
1263320	1271000	Douglas Adams, of course, all the way up to Q140 million at the moment. And this is just a number
1271000	1278120	that goes up every time a new Wikidata item is created. This Q2 has this property, highest point.
1281320	1286760	So this is this Q2 thing again, sorry. And this has this highest point, which is a property
1286760	1292840	in Wikidata, denoted by the P number here. And this is apparently the 610th property that was
1292840	1303240	ever recorded in Wikidata. And the value of the thing is here, the Q number for Mount Everest,
1303240	1310280	actually hidden by my little camera here. But this is, I can't read the Q number actually,
1310280	1315480	but this is a Q number. So it's always QPQ, hence the Q, so like this,
1316120	1325720	actually the classical semantical triple. So let's illustrate that a bit further by looking at
1325720	1332840	the item of the KB in Wikidata. And the KB has this unique identifier. So that is the
1333480	1339480	unique Q number by which the National Library of Netherlands is identified.
1340840	1347880	And this block on top, that's called the fingerprint in Wikidata terms.
1349800	1353800	This is multilingual. As you can see, there is a description in English, in German, in Spanish,
1353800	1360680	etc., also in Dutch, of course. And this has these fields of a label. So this is the title of the
1360680	1367320	item. And this is also reflected here. So if I were to change this, then this would change.
1368280	1373480	A little description, so a short characterization of what the thing is. This is the National
1373480	1379080	Library of the Netherlands. And here are these aliases, also known as alternative names,
1379080	1384760	by which this particular item is known, like the KB or the Royal Library, etc.
1387240	1393880	Next, if you scroll down that item page, then you will see that there is a claim made about
1394840	1400840	the country in which the National Library is. So this is again the same QBQ triple. So it's
1401560	1409800	the KB, Q number, this number. The country is identified by property 17 in Wikidata.
1410840	1418680	And the value of this property is it's in the Netherlands, which has number Q55.
1419400	1426600	And the place where this information comes from, the source reference, is listed as in this block.
1426600	1432920	This is called the reference. And it says, well, the claim that the KB is in the Netherlands is
1433960	1439640	drawn from this website, which was published in December 2019.
1442040	1445560	And this information was retrieved on this, the 12th of December,
1445560	1451800	2021. Everything that is in Wikidata should have a source reference. You can also see it here,
1451800	1458040	for instance, this claim has a reference, this has a reference, this not yet. But if you're
1458040	1465560	working on Wikidata, always try to add references to where you found the information that is being
1465560	1472840	given in the item. Then if you scroll down, you will see that there is a claim that the
1473800	1487720	KB is a member of a range of library associations. And if you look at this one, it's the KB is a member of the Conference of European National Librarians.
1489400	1496200	And in this bit, point in time 2002, so this claim was true in this year, this refinement,
1496200	1501080	that's called a qualifier. So qualifier is always the thing that refines the
1506040	1515560	how do you call that? The upper general, more general statement.
1519560	1525000	And finally, there is a list of external identifiers, just the same as I showed you with
1525000	1535160	the Eiffel Tower. And so these are all claims about the National Library. Okay, I actually
1535160	1543960	already mentioned that currently there are 9,000 over 9,000, to be said 9,045 different databases
1543960	1550040	known to Wikidata. And all these databases have their own properties. As you can see here,
1550040	1556520	these are all P numbers. So these all have their own properties. And actually, this is one of the
1556520	1563000	major functions of Wikidata is to be a hub on the internet to connect all kinds of databases
1563000	1570360	together. And I don't know any other registry or any other big place where so many different
1570360	1578520	databases are recorded. So if you want to discover obscure databases that you will never have heard
1578600	1586520	of before, Wikidata is the place to go to. If you just go to this and you check them out, you will
1586520	1597480	be amazed what kind of data is recorded in the world. And if you want to check out this information
1599640	1604520	in a bit more relaxed or laid-back manner, you can go to this page. This is a page on the
1604520	1611560	simplified data model of Wikidata. Basically, here is the same information as I just explained
1611560	1619560	to you is available, but you can read it at your own pace. And one thing I need to point out is
1620200	1628120	the following, that Wikidata has a version history. And this means that every edit that is stored
1629080	1636520	is stored forever. So everything you do in Wikidata is recorded. And you can always go back to previous
1636520	1645160	versions of the document and make sure that you don't put anything in Wikidata that is private
1645160	1655000	or secret. Because once it's in Wikidata, it is public forever. So be careful about what you add
1655000	1667240	to Wikidata. All right. Now let's look at some examples of what kind of information can be
1667240	1674440	requested from Wikidata. And I'm going to build it on three slides we saw before. The fact that
1674440	1681160	all the data in Wikidata is stored centrally. That it has all kinds of things, Wikidata,
1682120	1689240	and that everything is interconnected. Those three things, if you combine them together,
1689240	1694600	centrally stored, all sorts of things and everything is connected, you can ask really
1694600	1700600	interesting questions to Wikidata. If you want to ask questions to Wikidata, you do that via
1700600	1707720	a search language which is called Sparkle. It's like a dialect of SQL. And this is a common search
1707720	1714760	language for linked open databases. I'm not going to go into detail on Sparkle. That's an entire
1716200	1721560	day in itself, I guess. I can give workshops and lectures on that as well. But it's far
1721560	1729720	beyond the scope of this introductory workshop we're doing at the moment. But what I would like
1729720	1736360	to do now is to look at some results that you can get from Sparkling in Wikidata. For instance,
1737320	1744440	you can ask Wikidata, give me some depictions of house cats and you will get up this result.
1746040	1752440	And if you click on this link, it will trigger this gallery, this depiction gallery.
1753960	1759480	You can also ask Wikidata, give me a list of things that are named after French presidents,
1759480	1765080	but which are outside of France. And you will, for instance, discover that in
1765080	1772680	Ivory Coast, apparently there is a bridge named after General De Gaulle. You can really make
1772680	1781720	interesting discoveries. And in Poland, there's also a roundabout called, of course, named after
1781720	1790760	Charles De Gaulle, etc. Or you can ask, give me a list of the causes of death of American presidents.
1791400	1799960	Or you can say, man, Nobel Prizes were awarded last week. And I wanted to know, well, who were
1799960	1804680	Dutch people that were nominated for a Nobel Prize, but actually never won the prize?
1806280	1812520	You get this list and you see that the Dutch author of Simon Vesdijk, he was nominated 11
1812520	1819080	times for the Nobel Prize, but he never won it. That's quite sad. But if you think,
1819320	1826440	Simon Vesdijk is a sad guy, think again, because this guy, Johannes Willem Sommerfeld,
1827320	1836120	he was nominated no fewer than 84 times for the Nobel Prize, but he never won it. And, yeah,
1836120	1842760	the cruel thing is that all of his PhD students, of like, like, 10, I believe 10 or so of his PhD
1842840	1851640	students, were actually winners of Nobel Prizes. But the man himself never won it, I'm afraid.
1853880	1860200	This is also a really nice query to show you the power of Wikidata paintings with alliterative
1860200	1869400	titles. I think about, for instance, like, what was it, an Apollo artist,
1869800	1874200	Cesar Chechime, so all alliterations.
1877640	1882280	10 largest cities with female mayors, you can also request that these are the cities,
1882280	1889240	these are the populations, and these are the female mayors. And finally, you can request a list
1889240	1897080	of birthplaces of economists that already died, divided by time period. So these are the time
1897080	1902920	periods, and the different colors represent each one, one time period here. And these are the
1902920	1909640	places where these economists, these already deceased economists were actually born.
1914040	1920920	Okay, this is to show you the power of Wikidata, basically. And now for the next block,
1920920	1927800	I would like to look at the things we saw before, all quite, let's call it more technical,
1927800	1935240	more data aspects of Wikidata. And I would like to have a also look at the social slash community
1935240	1941000	aspects of Wikidata. And this, if you ask this question, who builds Wikidata?
1942760	1946200	Then the answer is the community, because it's a community project.
1946520	1954440	And here on this slide, you see a roughly 1% of all the people in the world that's working
1954440	1961720	on Wikidata. And what I already told actually is that there are currently 23,000 active contributors
1961720	1970280	to Wikidata. And it has been in existence since October 2012. So currently we're celebrating the
1970360	1977720	12th birthday of Wikidata. And since that time, they have made 2.25 billion edits, which is an
1977720	1986600	awful lot. These people don't only like to work on Wikidata as a data thing, but they also,
1986600	1994200	as you can see from this group, they like to meet each other. And when you become active
1995160	2001560	in the Wikidata community, as I said, you like to meet each other, but you also will,
2003320	2009080	by experience, be drawn to certain roles or certain tasks within the community
2009720	2016920	that you like more than others. And here you can see a number of roles that are
2018360	2023000	present in the Wikidata community. It can be a developer, or it can be an ambassador,
2023000	2033080	or it can be a translator. And when you look at a somewhat larger list of different roles you can
2033880	2041080	fulfill within the community, you will see that there are, this is not a hard division, but
2041720	2050600	I try to group the more hard data roles, like being a developer, or data editor, or data modeler,
2050680	2059640	or a SPARQL expert, here above the line here. But the nice thing about Wikidata is also that there
2059640	2066760	are lots of roles you can have in the community that are not really about hard data, but like,
2066760	2073960	you can translate in data in Wikidata, or you can be an event organizer. So all these events that
2073960	2079880	take place all over the world with subgroups of the Wikidata community, these are all organized
2079880	2085400	by those people themselves. So you can also, if you like organizing events, you can become a member
2085400	2092680	of the Wikidata community. Or you can do communication and outreach, or what I'm doing right now at this
2092680	2097000	moment, I can be a teacher, a trainer, and a speaker. This is also a role you can have
2098520	2105960	in the Wikidata community. So for every type of job role, there's always a place for you within
2105960	2117000	Wikidata. And another thing to shed another light on the community is the following. I asked
2117560	2125000	JetGPT last week, what can you tell me about the mindset behind the Wikidata community?
2125720	2132680	And it came up with this really great answer. This was spot on, so I just copied it. I didn't
2132680	2139640	try to paraphrase it in any way. It's all about openness and transparency. It's about
2139640	2145800	collaboration and collective intelligence, the wisdom of the crowd here. It's about inclusivity
2145800	2152760	and diversity. Everybody is welcome from all over the world, independent of country, sexual
2152760	2158280	preference, education, etc. You're all very welcome, independent of culture, language,
2158280	2167560	expertise, etc. It's all about innovation and experimentation. It's about a strong culture of
2167560	2178040	experimentation, which is exactly how I personally like to work. I like to experiment with stuff.
2179320	2186440	It's about supportive collective learning, and it's about having an impact on the entire planet.
2186440	2192920	It's a global database. It's a global project. And this is also in the mind of people working
2192920	2198440	on Wikidata, that you're not doing this for your own institution or your own country even, but it's
2198440	2210600	really geared towards the entire world. This also means, this community sense, is that people like
2210600	2215480	to meet each other, as I already said, and it really happens all over the world. These are all
2215480	2223560	images of celebrations of Wikidata birthdays in the past, and you see it's from Indonesia, India,
2223560	2231640	Nepal, Germany, Netherlands, Turkey, etc. So it's a really global community.
2235800	2242680	Once every year, on average, there is this big international meetup of people that like Wikidata.
2242680	2249000	This is called WikidataCon. And here you can meet people from all over the world that are
2251080	2259320	working and are enthusiastic about Wikidata. And one of the events that takes place right now,
2259320	2265320	this month, is the birthday celebration of Wikidata. Currently we do the 12th birthday.
2266200	2272440	And people, they come together, they really celebrate Wikidata, they bake cakes with the
2272440	2278600	Wikidata logo on it, and they have their favorite t-shirts on. And it's really, you see, quite
2278600	2288760	literally all over the world, Wikidata is being celebrated. Also, throughout the year, many
2288760	2293720	Wikidata workshops are giving, introduction workshops, as I'm doing at the moment here right now,
2293720	2300680	but also more advanced workshops are also given, or more specialized technical meetups,
2300680	2309320	like hackathons and editathons, they're also happening quite often. And as a good community,
2309320	2315160	of course, you have your community swag, you have your t-shirts and your caps and your
2315960	2322840	breadcases and your brooms and your pens, etc. And this is me personally wearing my Wikidata t-shirts,
2322840	2330200	etc. It says stickers, of course, to put on your laptops. This is also a manifestation of the
2331240	2339720	fandom that many people have about Wikidata. So I hope this little section gave you some feeling
2339720	2345640	of the human side of Wikidata, I think I call it that way, the social and community aspects
2345640	2355560	which makes Wikidata such a nice place. Okay, then I've arrived at the last part of my,
2356440	2362760	this particular presentation, this talk. And this talk, this part is to do with
2364280	2371240	illustrating how Wikidata can be relevant for research, science and cultural heritage.
2371240	2378360	And this is actually a section I made especially for this workshop, this lecture.
2379320	2387320	So let's find out what it is. I think this section will take about 15 to 20 minutes.
2388840	2397480	So then we'll have a full hour of presentation done. This is not much time, 15 to 20 minutes is
2397480	2404920	not a lot of time to actually talk about this topic. So as you will see, this section will be
2404920	2410760	quite anecdotic. It's not a concise treatment of all the various aspects of Wikidata has
2410760	2416040	in relation to research, science and cultural heritage. But it's like, I will bring forward
2416040	2424280	a number of use cases which hopefully will illustrate this sentence here in a nice way.
2425240	2430680	And when I was thinking how shall I introduce this part of the presentation,
2432040	2438440	I thought the following. My line of thought was as follows. In this slide that we saw before,
2440680	2445080	you see actually that Wikidata holds data about many fields of science and research,
2445080	2452360	like chemistry, astronomy, genetic sciences, scientific articles, biology and stuff,
2452600	2459000	and et cetera here. And what I thought, well, actually, I don't need to talk about
2459560	2466680	what Wikidata holds for science, but the other way around, what science holds for Wikidata.
2467640	2475560	So I looked up a visual representation of all of human knowledge. These are all fields of
2475560	2482440	human knowledge, as you can see. And I asked myself the question, to what extent is Wikidata
2482440	2492120	used throughout science research and GLAMP slash cultural heritage? And actually,
2493880	2499240	I didn't have an immediate answer to that. So I tried searching academic databases,
2499240	2505080	looking for articles on Wikidata, and then plot them on certain fields of knowledge.
2506280	2513160	And this was not immediately an easy exercise until I found this website. You can see here at
2513160	2519240	the very bottom of the slide, it's called SemanticScore.org. This is a service that you can
2519240	2525560	search over 200 million scientific articles with. And if you do this query, you can look for
2525560	2531000	articles that are related to Wikidata. And the nice thing about SemanticScore is that you can
2531320	2538760	filter on fields of study. And this is what I did to get an overview of this. And then I found out
2538760	2547640	that Wikidata is used in the area of gender studies, and also on history and linguistics,
2547640	2557400	and geography and sociology and information science, art, astronomy, biology and microbiology,
2557400	2564200	computer science, medicine, environmental sciences, and even in ecology.
2566280	2579800	So it's certainly not a full, not every domain of human knowledge is represented via Wikidata,
2579800	2584920	but quite a few. And I also think that increasingly, because I think if you did
2585000	2590200	that exercise 10 years ago, you would have far less white bins here. So increasingly,
2590200	2598040	you Wikidata shows its relevance for increasingly more fields of knowledge.
2600600	2607960	And what I would like to do now is to look at six case studies, six anecdotal cases. And
2607960	2611880	there's a little point, of course, I did it anecdotally, because it's about Wikidata.
2612840	2619080	And look at six use cases, which hopefully show or at least illustrate
2619960	2624840	how Wikidata can be relevant for that particular field of science.
2629160	2636040	And the first case study, the first case I would like to bring forward has to do with
2636040	2641400	the field of scholarly communication or scientometrics. And scientometrics is the
2643880	2649880	quantitative study of science and scientific communication. So for instance, if you want to
2649880	2658040	know who is the most cited author in a certain field of science, or the most prolific journals
2658040	2664840	in a certain field, that's the things that are being studied in scientometrics.
2665480	2672280	And a really nice scientometric tool is Skoolia. And what's Skoolia? Skoolia is a service that
2672280	2678760	creates visual scholarly profiles for researchers, articles, organizations, etc.,
2679320	2690120	all based on information from Wikidata. And I need to illustrate this, of course,
2691000	2696120	otherwise it will be a bit abstract. And the first profile that I would like to show you is
2696120	2701480	the profile from this professor here at Maastricht University, Gerard van Breukelen.
2702280	2710920	And this is a Skoolia profile of Gerard. And if you go to this profile, what kind of things will
2710920	2717480	you actually encounter? First of all, there's a list of publications. So where he was the author
2717480	2726040	or one of the co-authors of the article. I have to be specific, these are not necessarily
2726040	2732920	all the articles that Gerard published, because these are only the articles that are recorded
2732920	2740200	in Wikidata. And I'm not sure if Wikidata has a complete inventory of all of his articles.
2740200	2745800	But for the articles that are available, you can make this list. You can also make this plot,
2746360	2752440	like how many articles he published over the years, either as the main author or one of the
2753320	2764280	co-authors or as a lower rank author. You can see by this, how I call it, bubble chart,
2764280	2772200	it's called what kind of research topics Gerard van Breukelen is involved in, and also in which
2772280	2782360	journals he published most. The bigger ones are the most often, I'm sorry, the journals he used
2782360	2788520	most often for his publications, and the smaller ones are the less used journals.
2791400	2798520	This is a graph of the co-authors, so the people who Gerard van Breukelen collaborated with in
2798520	2805560	writing his articles. And you can also see where these co-authors work across the globe by this
2805560	2814200	co-author map. And finally, you can also check out which articles by Gerard van Breukelen were
2814200	2821720	cited most often. And apparently this ANCOPA paper was cited 206 times. And of course,
2821720	2829720	you can also give the number of citations over the years. So this is how such a profile on
2829720	2839720	Skoolia is composed. And the nice thing about Skoolia is that you cannot only request these
2839720	2847720	profiles for authors, for people, but also for organizations or for articles or for journals or
2847720	2856840	for topics like obesity or for taxons like the Moser-Saurus or chemical elements. These are all
2856840	2864360	possible, so you can have all these really nice ways to have various facets and spotlights on all
2864360	2876280	sorts of, let's say, classes of information. If you want to read more about Skoolia, I can
2876360	2883320	recommend the base paper of Skoolia where the project is introduced.
2884840	2893320	This one. And if you want to read on Wikidata about Skoolia, you can go to the Skoolia page on Wikidata.
2896200	2902040	Okay, the second one, the second field of science and research I would like to bring forward is
2902600	2912280	life and biomedical sciences. And I'm mainly doing this because the author of this particular paper,
2913080	2919320	Andra Waagmeester, is also a very active community member of Wikidata. So I know him
2919320	2928840	more from the Wikidata community than from this particular field. And I must be honest, I'm a bit
2928840	2937240	anxious. I'm holding my horses, let's say. I'm a bit anxious. That's too strong. But I'm not
2937240	2945080	very familiar in this field of knowledge. So I'm not going to talk about this in too much detail.
2947560	2951160	But what I would like to forward is that in this paper,
2952120	2958120	Wikidata is being discussed as a knowledge graph for the life sciences. And this paper demonstrates
2958120	2963240	several use cases of Wikidata, including crowdsource creation of biomedical ontologies,
2963960	2971320	phenotype-based diagnosis of disease. I have no idea what this means, but I'll just take it for
2971320	2976200	granted that some of you might know it. And drug repurposing. And if you want to read the full
2977160	2986040	article, of course, you can go here. Another article by Andra Waagmeester is this one. This
2986040	2995720	has to do with aligning knowledge surrounding corona viruses. When the pandemic struck,
2995720	3002760	it said here that there were a lot of projects and initiatives that rose up in the beta corner.
3003640	3011320	And these were all very loosely related. And there was a need to have a common ground to bring
3011320	3018840	together all these different projects. And in this paper, Wikidata is suggested as such a common
3018840	3029320	ground. So this is used to make data sources related to human corona viruses more interoperable.
3030200	3037400	So these are two papers by Andra Waagmeester. Actually, he took it a step further and he did
3037400	3051240	a PhD on biomedical sciences and Wikidata. Not exactly, but this PhD of his, which he defended
3051960	3060360	successfully earlier this year in January, it has a lot of Wikidata in it. I counted it and it has
3060840	3069800	415 mentions of Wikidata. I think this is the most Wikidata dense PhD thesis, perhaps,
3073000	3078680	for sure in this field of science. And I think perhaps in the Netherlands, perhaps even worldwide,
3078760	3084520	this is Wikidata is very prominent in this particular PhD.
3087640	3094600	This is another article on biological taxonomy. For reasons of time, I'm not going to
3095960	3099080	detail it. I'm not going to talk about it. Actually, I'm just showing it to you.
3099640	3106520	Of course, this presentation is also available as a PowerPoint and as a PDF file. And there's also a
3106520	3113880	full text version of this presentation where you can find the link to this particular article.
3113880	3119160	If you want to study it yourself, you can do it after this presentation.
3121720	3125160	And then the third field that I would like to bring forward is this one,
3125880	3132200	astronomy. And this is, let's say, the mirror opposite of life sciences, because
3133000	3138040	that's actually the topic I studied. I studied astronomy in the 90s in Leiden.
3138840	3144760	So I'm much more familiar with the type of information you see here than the type of
3144760	3151800	information you saw on the previous slides. So I was really happy to find a paper that mentions
3152360	3161960	Wikidata in relation to astronomy. And this paper talks about using Wikidata to disambiguate
3161960	3168120	planetary features. And what are planetary features? Excuse me, in this context.
3170360	3177240	Think, for instance, of craters on the moon and craters on Mars that carry the same name.
3178200	3182520	So if you have a paper, if you have an astronomical publication, and you want to do
3182520	3189960	named entity recognition on that paper, and you would encounter, for instance, I think it's called
3190520	3196520	Adams here, the crater is called Adams, you're not sure if that crater is situated on the moon,
3197080	3207640	or if it's situated on Mars. To make that process easier, this paper suggests that Wikidata can be
3207640	3215240	used for extracting planetary names, and to make that named entity recognition process and this
3215320	3219640	disambiguation process of planetary features more easily.
3222600	3228680	Another thing about astronomy, this is also, I'm just going to show you this, I'm not going to
3228680	3232920	discuss it, but you can study it yourself afterwards if you're interested.
3234520	3240120	Because I would like to move on to the next, the fourth case study on using Wikidata.
3240680	3244840	And this has to do with a very hot topic at the moment, large language models and
3244840	3252520	artificial intelligence. And this paper talks about using Wikidata to make large language
3252520	3259880	models more accurate and flexible. Here it says that all the facts that are stated in Wikidata,
3259880	3267720	some 12 billion, they can be used to train large language models to provide more accurate answers.
3268520	3275080	And the other way around is also true. This paper talks about using artificial intelligence and LLMs
3275080	3283240	to improve the contents of Wikidata. And you might notice in Wikidata that some fields are empty,
3283240	3288600	for instance, that not all fields have been fulfilled, or that certain languages in Wikidata
3288600	3296440	are underrepresented. And this paper suggests that artificial intelligence could build,
3296520	3308920	could fill those kinds of current gaps. This is another paper on IA and LLMs related to Wikidata,
3308920	3313960	but as with the previous two other papers that I skipped, I will also skip this one
3313960	3319800	for reasons of time. So if you're interested in that, yeah, you can study it yourself.
3320760	3328840	Because what I would like to spend the last five remaining minutes on of this talk is this one.
3328840	3335720	This is a case study from my own library, from the KB. And this has to do with GLAM and cultural
3335720	3343160	heritage. And the thing about the KB is that we have this really nice collection of what we call
3343160	3349240	our collection highlights. We have really wonderful manuscripts and old atlases and these really
3350440	3357320	lovely, hand-illustrated books about birds of the Netherlands from the 18th century, basically.
3358280	3366120	And we have about 80 of these most beautiful and important objects of our collection.
3366120	3370360	These are our collection highlights. And these are all part of our national heritage.
3373240	3379720	And when you look at the way that we make these collection highlights available through our own
3379720	3388280	websites, like our own KB website, but also our catalog, and the way we show the fully digitized
3388280	3394520	works, you will notice that they are really good to look at and to read. You can, for instance,
3394520	3399720	read about all these collection highlights on our own websites. You can all find them in our catalogs.
3399720	3405640	And we have these books you can leaf through with all the digitized images of all these
3406440	3414040	80 collection highlights. And the metaphor is that you can view them and you can see them and
3414040	3419080	you can read them, but you can't touch them. And what do I mean by you can't touch them?
3419880	3426360	Is that if you actually want to build stuff, you want to use these collection highlights as
3426360	3431800	building blocks, if you want to create something from these collection highlights, then our own
3431800	3438200	web services are not very suitable. And what do we have to think? If I say build stuff,
3439320	3444680	then like you say you want to make visualizations based on our collection highlights, or you want
3444680	3450360	to build apps that contain collection highlights, or you want to make data stories, or you want to
3450360	3458520	do AA stuff, or you want to build tools, etc. or games you want to use, you want to make a game
3458520	3464360	of our collection highlights, or offline you want to do a publication, or you want to do an artwork
3464360	3472440	on these collection highlights, then our own website and our own catalog are not really
3472440	3479560	suitable for that. It's not a place that offers building blocks. So if you think that idea through,
3480680	3485400	what you actually would like to have is something like that. You would like your collections
3485960	3493400	highlights to be some kind of a technical Lego set that contains building blocks with which you
3493400	3500280	can make all these things I just showed you. And if you look at this slide, it's no coincidence
3501000	3511400	that this Lego box is powered by Wikidata and also Commons and Wikipedia.
3512360	3519480	And how do you need to see this? This is about what I've called Wikifying our collection highlights.
3519480	3526120	So what we made sure we did a project on that in 2020. And we made sure that our collection
3526120	3535640	highlights were all described on Wikidata. And also subsets or deeper level Wikidata items
3535640	3542200	regarding those highlights were made. Next, we made sure that all the 11,000 images we had
3542200	3548520	from our AD collection highlights were available on Wikimedia Commons. And we made sure that most
3549160	3555720	highlights got Wikipedia articles. And I've summarized that process of turning our collection
3555720	3562440	highlights into Wiki building blocks. I call that Wikifying. And once you start Wikifying your
3562440	3570120	collections, then you will be able, you will get all kinds of new functionalities that you
3570680	3575480	can now do with your collection highlights that were not possible before.
3578360	3587720	Perhaps this is a bit abstract, but I invite you to read a five series paper that I wrote about this.
3588680	3594920	50 cool things that you can now do with KB collection highlights. And these, the first part
3594920	3601880	is a general introduction for why we did the project and how we Wikified our collection highlights.
3601880	3610520	And then in the four next episodes of this series, in roughly, let's say 12 new functionalities per
3610520	3618680	article, you can discover what kind of new things we can now do with our collection highlights,
3618680	3624120	because our collection highlights are now available in the Wikimedia infrastructure.
3625000	3630280	This is a really nice article that I really would like to encourage you to read it.
3633400	3636840	And then the last example that I would like to show you
3637400	3643160	is this one. This is from the American Physical Society. So that's the
3643960	3650440	organization that supports physicists in the United States. And they provide these trainings
3651160	3658440	that aim at elevating the achievements of women and other underrepresented groups via Wikipedia
3659080	3667800	and via Wikidata. The American Physical Society has such an initiative.
3670840	3674760	A similar initiative is done by the Smithsonian Institutions in Washington.
3676520	3683080	And they want to improve the representation of women in science, technology, engineering and math
3683640	3690440	by working on Wikipedia articles to improve those and create those for more female scientists
3690440	3698120	and also do that simultaneously on Wikidata. And if you get better information in Wikipedia,
3698120	3706040	you get better info boxes. Here this is a Wikipedia info box. And then in Google search results,
3706040	3712360	which is based on this info box, the information here will also be visible better.
3713080	3720360	So by working on Wikidata and Wikipedia, eventually Google will also be improved.
3724760	3729560	And if you want to read more about this, these were just six case studies where I highlighted
3729560	3737960	a number of papers. If you want to read more papers on science and Wikidata, you can go to
3737960	3745160	the little list I compiled here for you. It's various Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar that
3745160	3753320	I talked about before. And you can look for Wikidata articles yourself. Okay, this is pretty
3753320	3763240	much the end of my talk. Nearly finished. What I would like to show you before I really finish is
3763640	3770840	where you can find this presentation on Zenodo. If you go to this record on Zenodo,
3775000	3781000	then you can either download this presentation as a PowerPoint or a PDF.
3783720	3792200	And if you want to discover Wikidata further, because I was only able to show you a really
3792200	3798920	small part actually of all the knowledge related to Wikidata, you can go to this page on GitHub,
3798920	3806440	the Wikidata General Overview. And this is kind of a comprehensive introduction into Wikidata,
3807080	3813880	but quite compact. I tried to squeeze as much information on the basic level about Wikidata
3813880	3822920	into a big list. It's a big inventory of mainly links to other places for Wikidata.
3824520	3831160	I think this is a really good general introduction, general overview of Wikidata if you're relatively
3831160	3839640	new to Wikidata. Okay, that was my presentation. That was my talk. Thank you for your attention.
3839640	3847160	If you have any questions or any suggestions, please reach out to me. The preferred way is via
3847160	3853400	email here. This is my email address at the National Library. You can find all the information
3853400	3861720	here on Zenodo. And I would like to know if you send me an email. If you want to know more, we can
3861720	3869000	get in contact further. Okay, that was it for me. Bye bye. And I'll see you in the second part of
3869000	3874680	the presentation, or the second part of the workshop, which is the practical, hands-on part
3874680	3880760	of the workshop. And this is available in a separate video, which is also available from
3881880	3886680	Zenodo in due time. Bye bye.
