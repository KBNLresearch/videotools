00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hello, good afternoon everybody.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:10,960
Welcome to this practical part of the Wikidata workshop about professors at the University

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
of Maastricht.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,080
It's the 15th of October currently.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,440
And my name is Olaf Janssen.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,800
I'm the Wikimedia Coordinator of the National Library in the Netherlands.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,840
I must first mention that there is also a theoretical part to this workshop which is

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,120
available in the other video I recorded.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:37,240
So if you want to know the basics about Wikidata and its applications to research and science,

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,040
please consult the first theoretical part of the workshop.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,640
This is the second practical part.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,720
So this is especially if you want to get hands-on yourself with Wikidata and if you want to

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,920
work on Wikidata items that are related to professors here at Maastricht University.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,920
This part will be about 1 hour and 15 to 20 minutes if you do the full part.

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,960
So let me just walk you through this workshop.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,200
There will be about 30 minutes of practical exercises that you can do.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,880
For the rest I think I need to explain first a bit what the aim of the workshop is, where

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,080
you can find information related to professors of Maastricht University that you can then

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
include in Wikidata.

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,240
So first I'm going to try to give you some general context about the topic and then I'll

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,360
try to help you with making your first steps in Wikidata by adding and enriching the information

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,480
about university professors at Maastricht.

23
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,480
Okay, but before we continue, let me make sure that we're all on the same level, that

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:55,880
the Wi-Fi on your laptops is enabled and that you have actually created an account on Wikidata.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,440
I asked you to do that before the workshop today.

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,200
So I reckon you have done that.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,720
If you have not yet done that, if you still need to create a Wikidata account, you can

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:14,120
go to the URL that is shown here and do that during the first part of the workshop, because

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm not going to wait for that.

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,880
So you can do it right now.

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,240
Most importantly, what you will need for the workshop is the handout here that I made,

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,480
which is available from this URL here at Zenodo.

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,080
If you go to here, you can download the handout for participants.

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,880
In detail, it's available here.

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,760
This is the Zenodo page.

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,600
This exactly contains the same kind of information that is available as in the presentation that

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,320
I'm about to give, but then all written out so you can easily refer to your either Word

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,840
or PDF version of the handout.

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,720
If you want to be able to access the information that I will send you quickly.

40
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:13,600
Okay, having said that, let's first talk about professors as normal human beings.

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,880
Of course, they are humans.

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,720
What I intend to do in this part is just to look at the basic properties of professors,

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,440
like they have a date of birth, a place of birth, they have a sex or gender, they have

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,480
a name, etc.

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,560
Later in the workshop, in this practical part, I will look at the professional qualities

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:44,360
of these professors, like the fields of work they work at, where they were educated, what

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,480
sort of professor they were.

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,320
That's all about their professional activities.

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,920
By the way, here on the top of the screen, you can still see the Zenodo record.

50
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,360
If you have not yet downloaded or accessed this page to download the handout for participants,

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,080
you can do it during the first few slides of this workshop.

52
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,840
Okay, so when I'm talking about modeling professors, I'm talking about modeling humans.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:24,040
Then we have to look at how humans in Wikidata are actually modeled.

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,080
Then you have to think, well, what kind of really basic properties are needed to model

55
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,280
a person in Wikidata?

56
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,080
When you give that some thought, and you would look at already existing Wikidata items, especially

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,960
there are these properties that can be considered rather basic.

58
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,280
First of all, the statement if a person in Wikidata is a male or female or something

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
else.

60
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,920
Then the country of citizenship, so basically nationality.

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,760
Then the given name, the family name, and the name in the native language.

62
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,600
Date of birth, place of birth, date of death, place of death.

63
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,640
And then the native language the person speaks.

64
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,560
So if it is from the Netherlands, then it will be Dutch.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,920
But also the other languages the person is capable of speaking or writing.

66
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,040
So this is for the first bit of this section of the workshop.

67
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,000
Then after we've looked at it, we're going to look at the professional and educational

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,960
information about the professors.

69
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,440
But that's specifically for the second part.

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:44,280
Just to look at a quick example of these basic properties, I have the Wikidata item

71
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,720
about a famous Dutch astronomer, Jan Hendrik Oort.

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,960
My background, I studied astronomy in the 90s in Leiden.

73
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,120
So this is why I chose this not exactly random example, but it's a good example to illustrate

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,320
the basic properties of humans on Wikidata.

75
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,240
And first of all, we have the label.

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,960
So this is basically the name of this person, Jan Hendrik Oort, in all the different languages.

77
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,480
And then there is a short description about what kind of person Jan Hendrik Oort was.

78
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,680
He was a Dutch astronomer who lived between 1900 and 1992, actually.

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,920
And this is available in multiple languages.

80
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,680
I need to point out here that for every human on Wikidata, it's always an instance of human.

81
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,600
So this is a unique specimen of the group of humans.

82
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,280
And this is indicated in Wikidata by the property P31.

83
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,800
This is instance of, so a unique example of.

84
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,480
And then the value of that property is Q5.

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:05,360
So this is the class of humans on Wikidata, which is the fifth class.

86
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,080
Q1 is the universe, Q2 is the earth, Q5 is human, Q42 is Douglas Adams, obviously.

87
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:20,120
And this goes all the way up to currently Q114 million even.

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:30,600
Then if you scroll down that page, you will see that Jan Hendrik Oort is a sex or gender male.

89
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,800
Sex or gender is denoted by property P21 in Wikidata.

90
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,280
Country of citizenship, that's P27, which is the Kingdom of the Netherlands, etc.

91
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,120
So the name in a native language, the name in Dutch, is indicated by this property.

92
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:55,320
The given name, so that's his first names given by the P735 property.

93
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,880
The family name is one number down.

94
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:06,480
And so you can continue, the date of birth is P569, the place of birth is P19, etc.

95
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,480
You see, this is the date of death and the place of death.

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:17,440
So these are all properties in Wikidata that are related to basic data about humans.

97
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,640
And to continue to finish this up, the native language, so the natural language the person speaks

98
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,080
because he's a citizen of a certain country is P103.

99
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,080
And obviously, Jan Hendrik Oort was capable of speaking Dutch, which is indicated by this property.

100
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,080
Okay, you might wonder, why can I find all these different properties that are related to humans?

101
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Or is there a nice, compact overview of all these kinds of properties?

102
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,080
The good answer is, yes, there is.

103
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Because on this URL, so the Template:Person properties,

104
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,080
this lists all kinds of properties that are related to humans.

105
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Both really basic properties, like sex or gender or place of birth, etc.

106
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,080
But also a bit more advanced properties, like educated at and academic degree, etc.

107
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
That's what we'll look at later.

108
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,080
But these are the most important properties related to humans.

109
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Alternatively, you can go to the Wikidata Prop Explorer here at this page.

110
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,080
And if you collapse down the list of all the various properties,

111
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,080
then there is this thing called Wikidata Property for Items About People.

112
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,080
And here you see the same properties that I actually showed before.

113
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,080
So the place of birth, the place of death, etc.

114
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Sex or gender, P21.

115
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,080
All the way up to date of birth and date of death by this property.

116
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Family name, given name, etc.

117
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,080
So these are just the things I showed you already.

118
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Okay, so now for the first part of the practical exercise,

119
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,080
what we'll do in the first instance is to add basic properties for these professors.

120
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,080
And I have to give a bit of background to this exercise.

121
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Because the professors at Maastricht University and at many other universities in the Netherlands,

122
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,080
here on the screen, data about these professors has already been added to Wikidata

123
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:49,080
because of the so-called Wiki-scientist Project, which was started in 2019.

124
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Because then the first really big bulk of professors were added to Wikidata.

125
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,080
And it still runs till today.

126
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,080
And you can consider this workshop to be part of that Wiki-scientist Project.

127
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,080
So what the aim of this particular project was,

128
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:15,080
was to create and maintain centralized and structured data about Dutch professors

129
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,080
and other leading scientists all the way from the 16th century up to now

130
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,080
to be used by a wide audience.

131
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:32,080
And also to have the work-related data of these professors mapped onto Wikidata.

132
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,080
So recording information, for instance, about which university did they work,

133
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
when did they join the university, when did they leave the university,

134
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,080
what positions did they held at the university, etc.

135
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,080
And this is a project that is done on Wikidata.

136
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Hence, you see here, this is a Wiki project.

137
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,080
So that's a project where all the information is gathered on Wikidata.

138
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,080
And the project working environment, the documentation, etc.

139
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,080
is also available on Wikidata.

140
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,080
An employee of Maastricht University, Manuel Boessen,

141
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,080
he has written a blog post about this project.

142
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,080
And if you want to read the full background of the project,

143
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,080
you can go to the website of the Stichting Academisch Erfgoed,

144
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,080
which is the Foundation for Academical Heritage in English.

145
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,080
And this was the organization that actually initiated this project.

146
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,080
And they wrote, after the first year of the project,

147
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,080
I believe they wrote a report on the activities that were done during the project

148
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,080
and the results that were obtained.

149
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,080
And to place this project in a bit more wider context,

150
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,080
there are two other projects on Wikidata

151
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,080
that are related to higher education and universities, etc.

152
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
One is the Wiki project Higher Education,

153
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:10,080
which works on adding Wikidata or adding to Wikidata information

154
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,080
about universities and higher educational institutions.

155
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,080
And another project is especially about university degrees throughout the world,

156
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,080
because Wikidata has always an international scope.

157
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,080
So you could say that this Dutch Wiki-Wetenschappersproject

158
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:34,080
is actually a subset or a subproject of these larger, more encompassing projects.

159
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,080
All right. And then if you go to that page on the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject,

160
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:47,080
you will find a table where all the basic properties that we just discussed

161
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
are actually available here.

162
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,080
These are the same properties that I already showed you here.

163
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:01,080
So if you want to refer to this project specifically for the properties,

164
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,080
the properties specifically for the project, you can go to this page.

165
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,080
And our starting point will be this table.

166
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,080
This is a table for the University of Maastricht

167
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,080
where all the professors, all the hoogleraren are recorded.

168
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Well, not necessarily all the Maastricht University professors, but many of them.

169
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,080
Actually, the persons who agreed upon having their data recorded in Wikidata

170
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,080
at the start of the project in 2019.

171
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,080
But this table, it has some 300 Maastricht professors listed.

172
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,080
So this is a really excellent starting point if you want to improve

173
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,080
and add in data about professors at Maastricht.

174
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
This is a good starting point.

175
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,080
So we'll use that table to work from.

176
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,080
And in this table, all these basic persons data, as we saw before,

177
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,080
are listed for many professors.

178
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:09,080
And these columns in the table correspond to these properties in Wikidata that I showed you.

179
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,080
What you immediately see is that there are blank spots here in the table.

180
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:22,080
So this means that for this professor, the family name and the place of death is not recorded.

181
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,080
This is not a surprise because she's still alive, luckily.

182
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,080
So this will remain empty for a while, I guess.

183
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:38,080
But here you can see that the country of origin and the nationality is the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

184
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,080
And it is not available for this professor here in this field.

185
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,080
So we're going to try to improve this situation.

186
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,080
So what we're going to do now is the first level of exercise.

187
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:59,080
And the first level of exercise is actually to add data to Wikidata without the need for external data.

188
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:07,080
So we're not going to consult external resources, external references to add to Wikidata.

189
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
That we'll do in the next block.

190
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:16,080
But in this first block, we will actually get our information from already existing Wikidata items.

191
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:23,080
So we have this table again that we just looked at.

192
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,080
And you see here, this is a description of the person in Dutch.

193
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:38,080
And you immediately see that this is a short characterization of this professor Wil Albeda called.

194
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,080
And it's typically composed of fields like the nationality, Netherlands, Dutch.

195
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Something about the profession or occupation of this person, a political person and an economist here.

196
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,080
And if available, the year of birth and year of death.

197
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
So like in this case you see here.

198
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,080
And the good thing is about this table is that you can actually sort it.

199
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:08,080
And if you sort it, you will see that all the professors for which this description is not yet available are listed here.

200
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:21,080
So what we can now easily do, we can add information like the nationality, the profession, the fact.

201
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Because these are all Maastricht University professors, we can add that fact.

202
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,080
And if available, these years.

203
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
So that might look for this professor, that might look something like this.

204
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,080
The Netherlands, a Dutch psychiatrist and professor at Maastricht University.

205
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:48,080
So we can similarly, we can add this kind of information, not necessarily very like a copy of this, but something equivalent.

206
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:56,080
You could say we can add that to these, all these, all these professors that don't yet have that.

207
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Then next we'll see here at the far right of the table, this is sex or gender.

208
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:12,080
And this can often be derived, commonly typically be derived from the name of the professor.

209
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
And this is very easy, for instance, this is so this is about property 21.

210
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:25,080
So this person, Cees van Dam, obviously, if you know that he is a man and you can add male here.

211
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:33,080
And the typical values to choose from, if you make the classical subdivision male, female,

212
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:40,080
is male has this Q-number, which is shown here.

213
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:48,080
And female has this Q-number, which is shown here.

214
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
So it's either male or female.

215
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:59,080
And if a person is non-binary or something, there are also separate Wikidata properties for those types of sex or gender.

216
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:09,080
What is also quite easy to derive from existing information is the country of nationality, so P27.

217
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,080
And this can be commonly derived from the place of birth.

218
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Here we see that all these persons were born in either The Hague, Heerlen or Boksmeer, these are all cities in the Netherlands.

219
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:29,080
And it means that we can easily from this derive that the nationality of the person is Kingdom of the Netherlands.

220
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,080
And for Dutch persons, you have to be aware of that you actually choose Kingdom of the Netherlands here.

221
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:45,080
So this Wikidata item number and not Q55, which is the Netherlands, which is a different thing than the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

222
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:52,080
But the convention on Wikidata is to actually for Dutch persons do Kingdom of the Netherlands.

223
00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:03,080
And finally, we can also derive a family name and given name of the person from their already stated full names here.

224
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:12,080
So for instance, for this professor Wilko Letterie, his first name is Wilko and his family name is Letterie.

225
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,080
So that can also be easily added to Wikidata.

226
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Okay, so now let me try to give a live demo.

227
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Well, I actually can do that because I'm not recording my screen now.

228
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:38,080
But if you, this is quite easy to actually go to this Wikidata item and then have a short description of this person.

229
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Like he's a professor at, not sure which topic or which field of work, but he's a professor at Utrecht University.

230
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,080
And I think his birthday is already stated in Wikidata.

231
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,080
So you can actually use that information to add to the description.

232
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,080
And you can add that the given name is Wilko and his family name is Letterie.

233
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:19,080
And in an equivalent manner you can add to Wikidata on the item of Cees van Dam that the sex or gender of this person is male in this case.

234
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,080
So this is a short demo.

235
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,080
What I would like you to continue now is to go to this table here at this URL.

236
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,080
And then go to one of the Wikidata items.

237
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:39,080
I have to point out on the previous slide, not sure if I can actually go back to that slide.

238
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
No, I'm afraid not.

239
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Don't edit this, what I want to say, don't edit this table directly.

240
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Rather go to the Wikidata item here and make the edits in the Wikidata items themselves.

241
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:05,080
So you can choose a person from the list, see where information can be added, like this kind of information.

242
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,080
And then just edit the Wikidata item, store it.

243
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,080
And then once you have done that, and we take about 10 minutes for that.

244
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Don't forget after saving your edits to push here to click this.

245
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,080
This is not really a button, but this URL, this text here, to manually update the list.

246
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:42,080
And after you have done that, then the table here will be updated either immediately or if the system is slow, then within a couple of minutes.

247
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:50,080
And then this table will be updated and the information that you just added is actually available from here.

248
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Alright, so that's about 10 minutes of work.

249
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:05,080
And after you have hopefully successfully done that, we'll continue with the second block of this workshop.

250
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,080
And now we're going to try to add to Wikidata.

251
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Data that is related to the professional activities of these professors.

252
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:31,080
And this block is going to be a bit more complicated than the previous block, because we have to build up and improve our knowledge, of course.

253
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,080
But the structure of the data is also slightly more complicated.

254
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
So, yeah, let's go on and tackle that now.

255
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:50,080
But first, before I dive into this further, I have to make sure that we all have the same definitions.

256
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,080
And this has to do with defining what a professor is, basically.

257
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:06,080
I thought that I knew something about the phenomenon of professor.

258
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:20,080
But when I was preparing for this workshop a couple of weeks ago, I found out that there is much more nuance in professorships and the ranks and functions of professors than I was aware of.

259
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:29,080
So this is why I made this slide to actually make you also, if you're all working on a university, so I think you have some notion of professors, of course.

260
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:36,080
But it's good to have this clearly on a sheet.

261
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,080
And I'm deliberately using the Dutch word for professor, hoogleraar.

262
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Why I use that deliberately in Dutch, you will see in a moment.

263
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,080
But een hoogleraar, he or she is a university teacher of the most senior rank.

264
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,080
So, hoogleraar, that's a position, an office you can hold. In Dutch it's called a functie or an ambt.

265
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,080
So that's just a, yeah, like a job, a function.

266
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:28,080
And the funny thing about, at least in the Netherlands, what I found out is that an academic education or a PhD or a doctor's degree is not a requirement for if you want to become a professor.

267
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:45,080
Of course, it's highly unlikely that without a PhD you will get a professorship, but there are examples known that people that didn't study at university or only got their master's degree actually became professors.

268
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,080
You might be surprised about this fact. You can check the sources. I think it goes to Wikipedia.

269
00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:01,080
But I don't want to go on, I want to discuss this in more detail now because this is beyond the scope of the current workshop.

270
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Okay, then there is something called professor in Dutch. This is different from hoogleraar.

271
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:20,080
If I were to do this slide in English, then both these things would be professor because the English word for hoogleraar is professor.

272
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,080
But the English word for professor is also professor. So this is a Dutch word, professor.

273
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,080
And professor is an academic title and rank. So it's in Dutch an aanspreektitel.

274
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:52,080
And it's generally used for a university teacher of any rank. For instance, in the United States this is the case, but in the Netherlands it's especially true for the hoogleraar, so the university teachers of the highest rank.

275
00:26:52,080 --> 00:27:05,080
And professor is not something like an academic degree or something you can actually work for, you can study for, but it's like an attribute you get when you become a hoogleraar.

276
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:17,080
So this is the difference. It's a decoration attribute title you can use if you're a hoogleraar.

277
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:27,080
And then the academic degree. The degree at the university is something of course it gives to its graduates and it's actually something you study for.

278
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:35,080
So the highest degree that Dutch universities will give is the degree of PhD or doctorate.

279
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:50,080
And this is also the most common degree that the hoogleraar will have. They first did their master's thesis, then their PhD, and then they were appointed to be a professor at some stage of their careers.

280
00:27:51,080 --> 00:28:03,080
All right, so now how do all these kinds of different things and definitions translate into the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject and thus about the professors at Maastricht University?

281
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:13,080
And for that we go to the Wikiewetenschappers eigenschappen, the properties page again, which we saw before for these basic properties about professors.

282
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,080
And if you scroll down that page, you will come to the professional information for the professors.

283
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:39,080
And here you see quite a number of properties in Wikidata that are related to that professional activities like the occupation, the employer, so that's the university they work at, the university where they got their education, the academic degree they hold.

284
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:49,080
And here you see an entire blob of all kinds of different Wikidata items related to professors.

285
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:59,080
So let's look at this. I think if you see this, this is quite confusing. So let's look at this in a bit more detail. Let's use some illustration for that in other words.

286
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:13,080
And the Wikidata item I found, which was really good, was the item on Marleen van Baak. She is an emeritus professor at Maastricht.

287
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:31,080
And when I looked through this Wikidata item, this is like a really good example, a kind of canonical you could even call it. So this is the example I will use to demonstrate how professional data about hoogleraaren is recorded in Wikidata.

288
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:56,080
So the first thing to notice is that the occupation, that's P106 in Wikidata, is always university teacher, which is this number. This is true for all professors or all university teachers, not only at Maastricht University, but also for all the other universities that were part of the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject.

289
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:19,080
You could argue about this. I'm sure you could also say, is the university teacher, is that the best way to describe a professor at university? I'm not going to discuss that at this particular moment, because this was a choice that was made at the beginning of the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject back in 2019.

290
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:41,080
And I'm going to respect that choice, although I think you can debate about it, but this is the standard that is used throughout the project for all the universities. So I'm going to stick to the convention and not motivate you or change your mind that you would need to do this in a different manner.

291
00:30:42,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Then it says the employer of this hoogleraar is Maastricht University, so that's always P180 for Maastricht, this Q-number. And these two things that I showed you here, so that's the Maastricht University and the occupation being university teacher.

292
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:10,080
That's the definition to have a wetenschapper on the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject.

293
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:28,080
To continue, where was Marleen van Baak educated? As it said here, she was educated at the University of Maastricht. She got her, what's it called now, the master's thesis, master's degree.

294
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:51,080
These are the dates she started, she ended, and her field was biology. And she got her academic degree of doctorate, so that's her PhD, between 1975 and 1979. She was in the field of exercise psychology, and it was done at Nijmegen University.

295
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,080
So this is the way to record that kind of information in Wikidata.

296
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Then what you often see in the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject is a webpage where the person is described, and it's typically the homepage at the university the professor is associated with.

297
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,080
So in this case, this is the homepage of Professor van Baak.

298
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:34,080
What you also often see is the ORCID ID, which is property 496 in Wikidata and has this particular value. So if you click on this link, you will go to the ORCID ID page of Marleen van Baak.

299
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:45,080
One thing I did not yet discuss, but which I will show you now, is how that notion that Marleen is a professor is actually recorded in Wikidata.

300
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:54,080
Well, the way it's done is under employers, so that's the P108 Maastricht University here, which we saw before.

301
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:03,080
These qualifiers here are used to indicate that Marleen was a professor.

302
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:17,080
First, she was a normal professor, a hoogleraar, position held hoogleraar, but that ended because she got a pension basically, she got her emeritus.

303
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:28,080
And it's indicated here that from 2014 onwards she has a different position because their position now has become professor emeritus.

304
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:40,080
And you immediately see that professor emeritus and hoogleraar, those are two different things in Wikidata.

305
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:49,080
And actually it gets much more complicated because there are a lot of notions on professors in Wikidata.

306
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:58,080
Just to show you a few, now don't get scared because I'm going to show you this one, this is a Wikidata about a professor.

307
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:12,080
This is another one, this is even another one, professorship, full professor, an ordinary professor, an extraordinary professor, an assistant professor, an associate professor.

308
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:27,080
It goes on, a teaching professor, an honorary professor, an ecclesiastical professor, a visiting professor, an emeritus, a berufstitelprofessor, this is in German,

309
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,080
professor de universite, this is a French type of professor.

310
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:45,080
And then if you think now I've seen them all, you're very wrong because for the Netherlands there are even all these kinds of professorships.

311
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:56,080
So this is quite a lot and it's also quite confusing that there are so many types of professor, but this is the nature of Wikidata.

312
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Wikidata is an open project that everybody can add data to and this means that the ontology in Wikidata is also open.

313
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:14,080
So everybody can add their notion or their local or their national notion of different types of professors.

314
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,080
Sometimes that makes sense, sometimes it doesn't.

315
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,080
When it makes sense for instance is that the notion of professor in the Netherlands, this full professor in the Netherlands,

316
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,080
it's something else than the notion of a professor in Germany.

317
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
That's really a different thing.

318
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Or a professor in Sweden, that's also a different thing.

319
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,080
Or a professor in the UK or in the United States.

320
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Those are all slightly different notions of professorships which therefore have their own Wikidata items.

321
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:59,080
And obviously something like an ordinary professor or an extraordinary professor, those are also different notions.

322
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,080
And they have these special appointment professors or this is a typical Dutch thing, academy professor, etc.

323
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:14,080
So there are all these different notions on professorship which are in Wikidata for a reason.

324
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:22,080
It's very confusing if you are new to Wikidata and you're not familiar with all these kinds of, or you're aware of all these kinds of things.

325
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,080
But it's a thing to take into account of.

326
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:41,080
But what I would encourage you if you're working on Wikidata on Dutch professors, on Dutch full professors, I need to say always use this queue number.

327
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:52,080
A general other tip when working on Wikidata and if you're not yet familiar with how certain items are structured,

328
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:58,080
is then to look at good quality items of already existing persons in this case.

329
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:08,080
And for Marleen van Baak I showed you, but also Gerard van Breukelen, who we already saw in the first theoretical part of the workshop.

330
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:19,080
And also Bruno de Witte, if you look at their Wikidata items, the way their professional data is recorded, so the professor and educated ed and degree, etc.

331
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,080
That's really well done.

332
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:33,080
So if you can consider this to be canonical items to actually copy the structure of the data from these three examples.

333
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Okay, this is the thing I needed to say about professorships.

334
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:55,080
So what we're going to do now in the second practical block of the afternoon is to try to add professional data about professors to already existing Wikidata items, where we get that information from external data sources.

335
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,080
And let's look at how that can be done.

336
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:08,080
We'll start with the table that we saw before. So this is the overview table of Maastricht professors.

337
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:17,080
And what kind of information would we like to add now? We would like to add information from external public sources.

338
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:27,080
And the first one could be the place of birth and the date of birth.

339
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:40,080
So if you can find in a public, reliable, external source information about the date on which the person was born, you can add that to Wikidata.

340
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:47,080
And again, don't add it in the table directly, but add it in the corresponding Wikidata items.

341
00:38:47,080 --> 00:39:03,080
And then furthermore, you can add the information about the university where the professor was educated, the academic degree of the professor, the homepage at the university, and the ORCID ID information.

342
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,080
You can all add that to these related properties.

343
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Of course, when you find external information and you want to add that information to Wikidata, you have to state, you have to make clear where you found that information, where you got it from.

344
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:33,080
And for this case, for Bruno de Witte, it's stated that his employer is Maastricht University.

345
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:38,080
And you need to make clear where that information comes from.

346
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:46,080
And this is done by this block. So there is this information about his homepage on the Maastricht University website.

347
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:53,080
And from here, you can actually derive that his employer is Maastricht University.

348
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:05,080
And what you also need to do in general is to add information about when you added or when you checked that source for that information and when you added the information to Wikidata.

349
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,080
And when you look at here, how do you do that?

350
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:26,080
When you edit Wikidata, you get this edit screen and the reference URL, that's P854 in Wikidata, that states the URL of the page where the information was found.

351
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:35,080
And the retrieved date, P813, is the information or the date when the information was added.

352
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:43,080
So these are always the same things you have to put in Wikidata when you make a reference to a certain external source.

353
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Just to make clear, where can you find that kind of information?

354
00:40:51,080 --> 00:41:02,080
First of all, of course, you can find it on the public, the homepage of the university where the professors have their own homepage.

355
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,080
For instance, this professor, Wiebe Bijker, he's called.

356
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:15,080
He actually, when you go to his page, you scroll down, there is a full CV of all his activities.

357
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:22,080
And here you can find information about where he was educated, when he became a professor, etc.

358
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Another good source is the ORCID page of the professor or the page on ResearchGate.

359
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,080
You can also go to that site to find professional information.

360
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Of course, you can use Google to look for information on a specific person, like this one, Nancy Brocken.

361
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:54,080
You can also check the LinkedIn profile, that also gives information about the professor or if professors have personal websites or blogs.

362
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:04,080
You might also be able to retrieve, for instance, the year that they were born or the year they got their PhD degrees or something.

363
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:10,080
Furthermore, you can also look in Wikipedia articles about the professors.

364
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,080
These are some articles about Maastricht University professors.

365
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:25,080
And then I would suggest that you don't look at the Wikipedia article yourself, so don't get information from this part of the Wikipedia article.

366
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,080
But always go to the underlying sources of the Wikipedia article.

367
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,080
And here you can, if you check those sources, you can also find relevant information.

368
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
All right.

369
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,080
Then before we can actually get started, it's a pretty long introduction.

370
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
I'm very aware of that, but there is a lot to tell.

371
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:52,080
There are a lot of remarks to make before you can actually, with an informed mind, add information to Wikidata.

372
00:42:52,080 --> 00:43:00,080
So, although it might be a bit lengthy, I have to share this information with you because this is important, because we're dealing with living persons.

373
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Most of the university professors at Maastricht are still alive.

374
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:14,080
So that's why we have to be aware of the GDPR and the AVG conditions that apply to this exercise.

375
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:20,080
And information about the AVG is available from the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject.

376
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:36,080
And just to summarize the most important findings, it says that personal data about living persons we only include in Wikidata if they are publicly available from general information sources.

377
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
And this is a good guide to go by.

378
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:56,080
If there are some kind of, for instance, if you find information on a non-public site or if you have to log in to certain sites or if they're not generally publicly available, don't include that information in Wikidata.

379
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:13,080
And this is also stated by a report that was done after the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject by the SAE, the Dutch Academic Heritage Foundation.

380
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:26,080
They also give guidelines to which kinds of data are suitable for inclusion into Wikidata, given the GDPR AVG that is valid.

381
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:44,080
So in this report they state that, they ask the question, can we provide data about Dutch professors to the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject?

382
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:52,080
They said, yeah, we can do that, provided there is a public source mentioned.

383
00:44:52,080 --> 00:45:02,080
So this is from the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject point of view. Of course, Wikidata also has policies about living persons.

384
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:09,080
They're also aware of GDPR AVG, so they have their own policies to follow.

385
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:21,080
And they kind of say the same things. For data about living persons, it should be supported by a reliable public source.

386
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,080
And privacy should be respected. That's always the case.

387
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:33,080
So just to summarize the findings from both the Wiki-Wetenschappersproject and the Wikidata policies,

388
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:44,080
these are the guidelines that you need to be aware of when you add information to Wikidata.

389
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:52,080
So only add information from reliable public well-known sources. Always add references in Wikidata to those sources.

390
00:45:53,080 --> 00:46:04,080
Avoid what in Dutch are special persoonsgegevens, so special personal data like religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc.

391
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Don't include that in Wikidata unless you have explicit permission from the person itself.

392
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,080
Avoid things like home addresses, email, telephone numbers, information about partners, children, etc.

393
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:27,080
And even if the professor person provided himself, and why did I include this last thing?

394
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,080
This has to do with what I found in the CV of Professor Bijker.

395
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,080
When you go here, it just tells you where he lives. This is his personal home address.

396
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:45,080
Don't include that in Wikidata because this is personal private sensitive data.

397
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:52,080
He chose to put it on here, but just be careful, be mindful of Professor Bijker.

398
00:46:53,080 --> 00:47:01,080
Don't add that to Wikidata, because once it's in Wikidata, it will be in Wikidata forever, and it will be visible forever for everybody.

399
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:08,080
Okay, now I'm actually going to skip this part.

400
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:15,080
This is supposed to be me giving a live demo, but because of reasons of time, I'm actually going to avoid it.

401
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,080
It is not too difficult when you follow the instructions that I showed you before.

402
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,080
So now we can use 20 minutes of our time to actually go to work yourself.

403
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,080
Finally, I'm very aware that I've spoken a lot.

404
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:37,080
But this is the information you need to have one time, and once you know this, once you are aware of the information,

405
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,080
then you can add information to Wikidata forever.

406
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,080
So, start with what the exercise is.

407
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,080
From this table here, go to the table, see where there are empty cells in the table,

408
00:47:53,080 --> 00:48:00,080
and try to add information about where the persons were educated, academic degrees, etc.

409
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:12,080
based on information of external sources, and also include those sources in the Wikidata source references.

410
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:19,080
To make life easier for you, in the handout that you already downloaded,

411
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:32,080
at the very bottom of the handout, there is already a list that I compiled myself.

412
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:40,080
So if you don't want to go to too much trouble, and you want to add information about Willem Brouwer,

413
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:47,080
you can go to this page and you will find these bits of information that you can readily include in Wikidata.

414
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:55,080
And I did that for, I think, 15 to 20 professors, so if you're a bit lazy,

415
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,080
you can just copy basically the information that is given here.

416
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,080
But please also check the originating sources for this information.

417
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:16,080
And again, as I said, if you wonder how to do it, if you're a bit, perhaps if it's your first time working with Wikidata,

418
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:27,080
and you need some guidance and things to hold on to, go to either of these three items,

419
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:34,080
and you will find a really good example of how information in Wikidata for professors can be structured.

420
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,080
Okay, this is it for me for now.

421
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:47,080
Here on the third, this was supposed to be, because for reasons of time, I'm not going to try to discuss this.

422
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,080
If you want to do this, this is about creating actually new Wikidata items,

423
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:59,080
so we already looked at existing Wikidata items, if you want to create new Wikidata items for UM professors,

424
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,080
then go by these guidelines.

425
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:12,080
So find the professor that is not yet described in that Wiki-Wetenschappers table.

426
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,080
For instance, you can find one here.

427
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,080
Then try to gather information about this person from reliable public sources.

428
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:26,080
And then please pay attention to AVG GDPR and privacy guidelines.

429
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:38,080
And then add that information to Wikidata, based on the examples of Marleen van Baak, Bruno and Gerard van Breukelen.

430
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,080
Okay, that was it for me. I think I've talked enough.

431
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,080
It's really time for you to actually go and exercise yourselves.

432
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:55,080
If you have any questions or any suggestions, feel free to send me an email at olaf.janssen@kb.nl

433
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,080
This is the National Library in the Netherlands, where I'm the Wikimedia Coordinator.

434
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:08,080
And we can also get in touch via video or telephone or something, or chat.

435
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:15,080
It's all available if you need any support in adding data to Wikidata.

436
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,080
Okay, thank you very much. Bye bye.
